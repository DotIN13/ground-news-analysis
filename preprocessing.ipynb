         "At least six babies have died in the past two weeks in Gaza due to the cold weather and lack of adequate shelter and heating, Palestinian medics and health officials say.\nDoctors at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City, in the north, said nine newborn babies suffering from cold injuries had been admitted, five of whom had died, with one other in a critical condition.\nThe family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight.\nThe PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters.\nAccording to meteorological websites, the night-time temperature in Gaza has regularly fallen below 10C (50F) over the past two weeks.\nIt dropped to 3C (37F) on Monday night, after the PFBS hospital's medical director Dr Saeed Salah had warned in a video that three babies suffering from cold injuries, including hypothermia, had died over the same period.\nHe said the babies were only one or two days old, and had weighed between 1.7kg and 2kg (3.7-4.4lbs).\nOn Tuesday, Dr Salah and a paediatrician at the hospital, Dr Samer Lubad, reported that another two newborns had died.\n\"The last several weeks we [had] nine neonates in our hospital. And they came with case that they call 'cold injury' or hypothermia,\" Dr Lubad told Al Jazeera TV.\n\"Three babies survived and were treated successfully and discharged home. There is still one baby in our neonatal ICU in a critical general condition.\"\nHe added: \"Of course, this condition is because of the cold weather and lack of safe shelters, lack of central heating, and lack of electricity in the Gaza Strip.\"\nMeanwhile, the head of the paediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis told the Associated Press that it had received the body of a two-month-old girl who had died of hypothermia on Tuesday.\nA video posted by a local journalist appeared to show the girl being buried by her father and uncle, who said she was named Sham Yousef al-Shambari.\nHe said she had been healthy and that her mother had found her \"stiff as wood from the cold\" when she tried to wake her for feeding during the night inside the family's tent in the al-Mawasi area.\nDr Muneer al-Boursh, director general of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said in a statement a total of 15 children had died due to the cold since the start of the winter.\nHe also alleged that Israel had \"failed to comply with humanitarian protocols, including allowing the entry of medical equipment, heating supplies, tents, and mobile homes\" since the ceasefire began on 19 January.\nHamas has previously said that Israel was required to allow in about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans during the six-week-long first phase of the deal.\nIsraeli military body Cogat said Israel was \"committed to and complies with the obligation to allow the entry of 4,200 humanitarian aid trucks per week\" into Gaza, including those carrying tents and shelter supplies.\n\"Based on the data available to us, hundreds of thousands of tents have entered the Gaza Strip since the agreement came into effect,\" it added.\nIt comes amid continued uncertainty over whether the ceasefire will continue past Saturday, when the deal's first phase is set to expire.\nOn Sunday, Israel postponed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for 10 hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, accusing the group of cynically using its hostages for propaganda purposes.\nHamas accused Israel of a \"blatant\" violation of the deal and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\nAt least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",

         "At least six infants have died from hypothermia in the last two weeks in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of people are living in tent camps and war-damaged buildings during a fragile ceasefire, Palestinian medics said Tuesday.\nTemperatures have plunged in recent days. The coastal territory experiences cold, wet winters, with temperatures dropping below 10C (50F) at night and storms blowing in from the Mediterranean Sea.\nDr Ahmed al-Farah, head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told The Associated Press that it received the body of a 2-month-old girl on Tuesday. He said another two infants were treated for frostbite, with one of them discharged later.\nSaeed Saleh, of the Patient's Friends Hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger have died from the cold over the last two weeks, including a 1-month-old who died on Monday. He said another child has been placed on a ventilator.\nZaher al-Wahedi, head of the Gaza Health Ministry's records department, said it has recorded 15 deaths from hypothermia this winter, all of them children.\nThe ceasefire that paused 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas militants has allowed a surge in humanitarian aid, mainly food, but residents say there are still shortages of blankets and warm clothing, and little wood available for fires.\nThere's been no central electricity in Gaza since the first few days of the war, and fuel for generators is scarce. Many families huddle on damp sand or bare concrete.\n“It’s incredibly cold,” Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for the United Nations children's agency, said earlier this month. “I have no clue how people can sleep at night in their makeshift tents.”\nIsrael's military offensive, launched in response to Hamas' 7 October 2023 attack, was among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history. It pounded large areas of Gaza into rubble. The hundreds of thousands of people who have been able to return to northern Gaza under the ceasefire have settled wherever they can amid the ruins.\nThe ceasefire's first phase will end on Saturday and may not be extended. If fighting resumes, the current flow of humanitarian aid is expected to drop dramatically.\nEven if the truce endures, it's unclear when anything in Gaza will be rebuilt. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction at over $50 billion, and it could take years just to clear the rubble.\nIsrael blames the destruction on Hamas because the militants positioned tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure in residential areas.\nHamas has accused Israel of delaying the entry of mobile homes and tents in violation of the ceasefire. Israel denies the allegations and accuses Hamas of violating the agreement. Israel held up the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners last weekend to protest Hamas' practice of parading hostages before crowds in public spectacles during their release.\nHamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted around 250 hostages. Over 60 are still held in Gaza, around half believed to be dead.\nIsrael's air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many of those killed were militants. Israel says it killed over 17,000 fighters but has not provided evidence.",

         "WARNING: This story contains an image of an infant with serious injuries and a description of the injury and death of several other babies.\nAt least six infants have died from cold-related injuries over the past two weeks in the Gaza Strip, local medics say, due to a lack of adequate shelter and heating.\nTemperatures have plunged in recent days across the war-torn enclave, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians having little to no shelter from the cold, living in makeshift tent camps or destroyed buildings. Local officials have been calling for more humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip — including tents, mobile homes, fuel and heavy machinery to clear the rubble — amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\nDr. Saeed Salah, director of the Friends of the Patient medical facility in Gaza City, said the wave of cold weather has largely affected infants aged one month or younger.\nFive of the six infant deaths were reported by the hospital, Salah said, and they made up about 60 per cent of its infant patients who were admitted due to \"cold injury,\" including hypothermia.\n\"These [babies] are living with their families in a very bad situation … They're living in tents with no facilities for warming, no electricity, no fuel,\" he told CBC News Tuesday.\n\"That's why this critical [age] group, infants, is suffering from the cold.\"\nDr. Ahmed al-Farah, head of the pediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, told The Associated Press that it received the body of a two-month-old girl on Tuesday.\n\"I unbuttoned her clothes and patted her, but there was no breath or heartbeat,\" said the girl's father, Yusuf al-Shinbat, who found her in the early morning. \"Yesterday, I was playing with her, bathing her and scenting her. I was happy with her. She was a [beautiful] child, like the moon.\"\nAl-Farah said another two infants were treated for frostbite at Nasser Hospital. One was discharged later, while the other was in intensive care.\nThe body of one \"was completely blue and his temperature was very low,\" the doctor said.\nThe Gaza Strip, which is on the Mediterranean coast, experiences cold and wet winters, with temperatures dropping below 10 C at night.\nSalah said before the war, the hospital would see one or two cases of infant deaths from hypothermia in the winter season. That figure has increased to 15 this winter season, according to Zaher al-Wahedi, head of the Gaza Health Ministry's records department.\n'Children cannot handle it'\nWissam Hamad, a 30-year-old father of two, walks 16 kilometres each day to get to the Friends of the Patient medical facility in Gaza City from the northeast city of Beit Hanoun to see his son, a three-week-old patient there suffering from severe cold injuries.\n\"We have no operating hospitals in Beit Hanoun or the north,\" Hamad told CBC News Tuesday.\n\"The cold that we're experiencing, the children cannot handle it … we're living in tents or sheltering in schools that have broken walls or windows. I have no means of heat in our tent.\"\nThe ceasefire that paused 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas militants has allowed for a surge in humanitarian aid, mainly food, but residents say there are still shortages of blankets and warm clothing, and there is little wood available for fires.\nThere's been no central electricity in Gaza since the first few days of the war, and fuel for generators is scarce. Many families huddle on damp sand or bare concrete.\nThe infants' deaths come as World Health Organization (WHO) officials said the U.S. administration's suspension of funds has frozen critical operations in the enclave.\nThe move by the Trump administration to withhold $46 million US slated for operations in Gaza leaves six areas underfunded, a top WHO official in the region said Tuesday.\nDr. Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for occupied Palestinian Territories, said those areas include EMT operations, rehabilitation of health facilities, co-ordination with partner organizations and medical evacuations.\nSpeaking from Gaza to reporters at a UN briefing in Geneva Tuesday, Peeperkorn said money for such operations remained in WHO's funding pipeline and \"we're still going full steam ahead\" with activities.\nTarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesman, said he did not have figures about how the U.S. funding cuts affected the entirety of its operations worldwide.\n1st phase of ceasefire set to end Saturday\nIn a statement Monday, Palestinian militant group Hamas accused Israel of obstructing humanitarian aid and shelter materials, saying it directly resulted in the deaths of the six infants.\nIt called on the mediators involved in the ceasefire deal to ensure the entry of essential supplies such as shelter, heating and urgent medical items into Gaza.\nIsrael's military offensive, launched in response to the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack, was among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history. It pounded large areas of Gaza into rubble and displaced roughly 1.9 million Palestinians. The hundreds of thousands of people who have been able to return to northern Gaza under the ceasefire have settled wherever they can amid the ruins.\nThe ceasefire's first phase will end on Saturday and may not be extended. If fighting resumes, the current flow of humanitarian aid is expected to drop dramatically.\nIsraeli officials said Tuesday that Israel is considering an extension of the 42-day truce in Gaza.",

The last few days have been especially cold.\nYusuf al-Shinbari woke up in his family’s tent just after midnight on Tuesday to find that his 2-month-old daughter, Sham, was cold to the touch. He could feel no heartbeat.\n“Yesterday, I was playing with her,” he said. “I was happy with her. She was a beautiful child, like the moon.”\nDr. Ahmed al-Farah, the head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, where her body was taken, said she did not have any illness but died from severe cold because she was in a tent.

Israel denies the allegations and accuses Hamas of violating the agreement. Israel held up the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners last weekend to protest Hamas’ practice of parading hostages before crowds in public spectacles during their release.\nHamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted around 250 hostages.

         "GAZA, Feb. 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of infant deaths due to the ongoing cold wave in the Gaza Strip has risen to six, Palestinian medical sources reported on Tuesday.\nMunir Al-Bursh, director-general of the Gaza-based health authorities, said in a press statement that \"the number of children who have died due to the severe cold has risen to six\", noting that the total number of child deaths due to low temperatures since the beginning of winter has reached 15.\nHe warned of a worsening health crisis, as the destruction of medical infrastructure continues to hinder healthcare services in the region.\nAl-Bursh stressed that hospitals, particularly pediatric clinics, are struggling to provide essential medical care amid severe resource shortages and frequent power outages.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Saeed Salah, director of the Friends of the Patient Charitable Hospital in Gaza City, said that at least three infants had died in the past few hours due to severe cold and the absence of adequate heating in their shelters.\nGaza has been experiencing a harsh cold wave in recent days, with strong winds, heavy rain, and low temperatures. The extreme weather has uprooted hundreds of tents and flooded many displacement camps, exacerbating the suffering of thousands of families.\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East has previously warned of the increasing risks to newborns in Gaza, reporting that 7,700 infants lack the medical care necessary for survival amid worsening conditions and a severe shortage of safe shelters.",

         "Seven babies have died from hypothermia in Gaza since Sunday, according to health care officials in the strip, who warn there will be more such deaths unless more aid enters the enclave.\nDr. Saeed Salah, the medical director of the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital (PFBS), northern Gaza, warned of a “disaster” in the rising number of babies suffering from hypothermia, as they try to survive winter conditions in the strip.\nIn the past two weeks, eight babies with hypothermia were admitted to the medical facility in Gaza City, said Dr. Salah. Of those, three were admitted to the intensive care unit and three others died “within hours” of arrival.\nOn Tuesday, a fourth baby who was just 69 days old died overnight, Dr. Salah added. Further south, two other babies with hypothermia symptoms died in Nasser Hospital, Khan Younis, health workers there told journalists.\nThen on Wednesday, the death toll rose to seven after Seela Abdel Qader, who was less than two months old, died, according to Dr. Munir Al-Bursh, the director general of Gaza’s Ministry of Health.\n“Cold waves are causing more victims every day, especially among newborns, due to the (Israeli) occupation’s destruction of their health facilities, as well as the destruction of medical equipment and devices for newborns,” Dr. Al-Bursh said in a statement published by the health ministry Wednesday.\nDr. Salah said more caravans, tents and fuel were needed to “bring warmth to the people.” He added that such provisions would stop this kind of “catastrophe from repeating itself” and “prevent the death of neonatal babies from hypothermia and frostbite.”\nA fragile ceasefire has offered a moment of reprieve for people in Gaza from Israel’s months-long military campaign that it launched in response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and saw more than 250 taken hostage.\nAt least 48,348 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and another 111,761 people injured, the Ministry of Health there reported on Tuesday.\nSurvivors say they are struggling to rebuild communities and reconcile the destruction wrought – which gutted the medical system, and spawned a crisis of starvation, displacement and disease. Just 20 out of 35 hospitals are partially functional, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nHamas has repeatedly accused Israel of preventing the entry of humanitarian aid into the strip in violation of the ceasefire agreement – accusations that Israel has denied.\nOn February 14, COGAT said that 4,200 humanitarian aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip that week, carrying food, fuel, medical supplies, tents and shelter equipment, in compliance with the ceasefire and hostage deal. Since the start of the ceasefire on January 19, 16,800 trucks of aid had entered Gaza, COGAT added.\n‘Man-made crisis’\nIn Nasser Hospital, a Palestinian mother gently stroked her tiny, pale baby, who was swaddled in blankets. Two-month-old Yousaf Al-Najjar is one of many neonatal patients being treated for hypothermia there.\nCNN footage from the hospital on Tuesday showed the mother trying to check the temperature of her baby boy, who she said has become like “a skeleton.” The family is displaced inside a tent nearby, with at least 15 other relatives.\n“I put my lips on his face and feet, and they have become frozen,” she told CNN. “Children are being brought in dead from the cold weather.\n“We don’t have covers or anything,” she added. “I see death in my son.”\nBaby Yousaf was born prematurely, according to Dr. Fida’a Al-Nadi, a pediatrician at Nasser Hospital. His weight of two kilograms has made him more vulnerable to hypothermia, Dr Al-Nadi told CNN.\n“Every day we are dealing with children (suffering) hypothermia, many of them die,” she said on Tuesday. “The problem is not the hospital; it’s the conditions where the children are living, either in tents or destroyed homes.”\nIsrael’s war in Gaza has pushed many Palestinians into tent camps. At least 1.9 million people have been displaced, according to the UN. Many have sought refuge in sprawling outdoor areas, living for months in makeshift tents made of cloth and nylon – with little access to warmth, electricity or heating. In cold weather conditions, newborns and children up to three months are among those most at risk of respiratory infections, lack of blood supply, and infections, Dr Al-Bursh said last week.\nFikr Shalltoot, the Gaza director for the UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians, said the deaths of those six Palestinian babies “is the direct result of Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid.”\n“Newborns should not be dying of hypothermia in Gaza. This is not a tragedy of nature but a man-made crisis,” Shalltoot said on Tuesday, in a statement shared with CNN. “If adequate aid, including shelter supplies, were allowed to reach civilians and hospitals, these deaths would be entirely preventable.”",

Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.\nThe Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.\nHezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.\nGaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.",

         "At least six newborn babies have died in Gaza due to severe cold, according to Dr Saeed Saleh, a health official at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society Hospital (PFBS) in the enclave, in a recorded video on Tuesday.\nDr Saleh said that in the past two weeks, eight newborns were admitted with severe cold-related injuries, six of whom later died.\nThe hospital highlighted the dire living conditions facing Palestinians, who are currently residing in tents and bombed-out homes, with no protection from the freezing temperatures currently sweeping across the Middle East.\nHealth officials at the hospital called on mediators in the conflict between Israel and militant group Hamas to urgently provide mobile homes as temporary shelters for more than 280,000 families who are homeless after Israeli airstrikes.\nThey also called for fuel deliveries to ensure warmth and safeguard young children from the harsh weather conditions.\nIsrael and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire in Gaza on 19 January to end nearly 16 months of conflict and allow the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.\nHowever, the truce is fragile with both sides accusing the other of violations. Last week, Hamas threatened to postpone the scheduled release of hostages after it said Israel had delayed the promised entry of mobile homes into the devastated strip.\nHamas blamed the deaths of the newborns on Israel's \"criminal policies,\" accusing Israel of obstructing humanitarian aid.\nIsrael did not immediately comment on the reports of the newborn deaths. It has consistently denied restricting aid.\nInternational aid officials have confirmed that aid is getting into Gaza despite logistical problems, but they warn more was needed.\nWHO concerned over attacks in West Bank\nThe World Health Organization said it is deeply concerned about violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the impact of \"starkly rising\" attacks on healthcare.\nIsrael sent tanks into the West Bank for the first time in more than 20 years on Sunday and ordered the military to prepare for an \"extended stay\" to fight Palestinian militant groups in the area's refugee camps.\n\"We are deeply concerned about the situation in the West Bank and the impact on health\", Dr Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the West Bank and Gaza, told reporters via video link from Gaza.\n\"We see the current flashpoints of violence, attacks on healthcare ... starkly rising in the West Bank.\"\nThe WHO says there have been 44 attacks this year that affected the provision of healthcare in the West Bank, with four healthcare facilities impacted.\nFour patients died waiting for an ambulance and eight health workers were injured while attempting to reach patients, it said.\nIt also said 25 healthcare workers and patients had been killed and 121 injured in the West Bank from 7 October 2023 - the date of the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the Gaza war - to 14 February this year.\nThe WHO also reported \"severe movement restrictions\" across the West Bank, including obstacles affecting the movement of ambulances and access for healthcare workers.\nThe WHO has provided emergency supplies and trauma kits to some West Bank hospitals, Dr Peeperkorn said.\nAt least 40,000 Palestinians have left their homes in Jenin and the nearby city of Tulkarm in the northern West Bank since Israel began its operation last month after reaching a ceasefire agreement in Gaza after 15 months of war.\nEighty-two Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between 1 January and 13 February, according to the latest WHO figures.",

         "LOADINGERROR LOADING\nAt least six Palestinian newborn babies have recently died from extreme cold in Gaza, as families try to survive the winter with virtually no shelter, no heating and an insufficient amount of humanitarian assistance.\nThe Friends of the Patient Charity Hospital received nine cases over the past two weeks of premature infants experiencing breathing difficulties, blood circulation failure, low blood pressure and some organ dysfunction caused by the harsh weather, hospital director Saeed Salah said Monday. When the babies arrived at the hospital’s neonatal unit, Salah said their body temperatures were below 34 degrees Celsius — in other words, hypothermic.\nAdvertisement\n“We treated these infants immediately, following the established protocol for cold injury,” the doctor told Middle East Eye. “However, while we managed to save some cases, we were unable to save others. This was due to their critically low body [temperature] or because they arrived too late.”\nOut of the nine babies, five of them died. Three of the remaining infants were treated and discharged to their families, while one remains on a ventilator receiving critical support as medical workers stabilize blood pressure. Separately, another infant died from the cold Tuesday morning — this time in southern Gaza, while inside her family’s tent.\nAdvertisement\nThe five infants who passed at the hospital had come from north Gaza, which until the current ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas had been walled off from humanitarian assistance as Israeli forces turned the region — from families’ homes to hospitals — into rubble. Displaced Palestinians have begun to return north, but have little to no shelter and no heat in the middle of a cold, rainy winter.\n“Cold is definitely an issue. And even people who return to their homes, usually they don’t have four walls around them. They just have some kind of solid structure that they use as a shelter, and then they still put their tarps,” Dr. Adam Hamawy, who recently volunteered in Gaza, told HuffPost earlier this month.\n“They’ve taken their tents with them to what’s left of their homes to survive there. And they don’t have electricity, no refrigeration, no lights,” he continued. “It’s not like everyone just gets to go home. There’s not much standing left that has been untouched in Gaza.”\nAdvertisement\nLocal journalists have documented Palestinians’ struggle to survive in the winter with only a tent — made of items like fabric, plastic and cardboard — that often gets flooded due to the frequent rain and wind. More than 945,000 Palestinians are in need of winterization support, according to the United Nations.\n“Adults can survive the 50-degree winter — but even adults, not if they’re wet constantly. I mean you’re talking about being wet for three months straight,” Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, who has volunteered in Gaza, told “Democracy Now!” in December. “And furthermore they’re not just wet, they’re living in a land that literally doesn’t have a sewage system anymore. It’s one of the most crowded places in the world. … 1.8 million people are living in a place that has 121 toilets. This is just outrageous.”\nAdvertisement\nThe UN agency responsible for assisting Palestinian refugees said that eight babies died of extreme cold in January alone — putting the total number of babies who died of hypothermia this winter at 15.\n“For kids in these conditions, it’s not only frightening to be outside, exposed and in the cold, but it’s also very dangerous for their wellbeing,” UNICEF spokesperson Tess Ingram told Al Jazeera.\n“We’ve had a number of children in Gaza die of hypothermia and it’s clear here when you meet with families that they don’t have what they need to protect them from that cold,” she continued. “Families are lacking warm clothes for their children. There’s many children without shoes.”\nAdvertisement\nWhen the ceasefire agreement went into effect on Jan. 19, Israel agreed to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza — including 60,000 caravans and 200,000 tents. But aid groups and Palestinians say that the shelter and fuel aid coming into the territory isn’t remotely sufficient.\n“My understanding from our humanitarian colleagues is that there’s been a lot of challenges in getting tents and caravans and tarpaulins in,” Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, said on Tuesday. “We continue to push. Some are going in, but we need more.”\nAdvertisement\nAid trucks entering Gaza in January carried 4,807 tons of shelter equipment, 1,556 tons of gas and 1,244 tons of medical supplies, according to data from COGAT, the Israeli military’s branch that oversees the aid going into Gaza. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency also distributed a total of 2,485 tents earlier this month in northern Jabalia and Gaza City, while last week shelter partners distributed 2,358 tents in the north.\nA spokesperson for COGAT did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.\n“The failure to provide these essentials, combined with the extreme cold, will inevitably increase the death toll. This is why I urge everyone to acknowledge the gravity of the situation,” Salah said. “We’re talking about five deaths in two weeks. This is a shocking figure that cannot be ignored.”",

         "GAZA CITY, Palestine\nSix newborn babies froze to death in the Gaza Strip amid cold weather in the war-torn enclave, a Palestinian health official said on Tuesday.\n“Six infants died from severe cold in Gaza,” Marwan al-Hams, Director General of Field Hospitals in Gaza, told the local Al-Aqsa TV.\nHe appealed for allowing access to power generators and oxygen stations to help hospitals provide services to Palestinians.\nSaeed Salah, Director of the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in Gaza, told Anadolu early Tuesday that nine infants were hospitalized in the past two weeks due to health complications caused by severe cold.\n“Of the nine cases, five babies aged between one day and two weeks died,” he said.\nHe said the nine babies were transferred to the hospital from northern Gaza, where most of the population has been displaced and living in tents following Israel’s destructive war on the enclave.\nSalah appealed to the international community to intervene to allow the entry of mobile homes, tents, and fuel into Gaza to provide shelter to thousands of Palestinians.\nThe Palestinian resistance group Hamas blamed Israel’s “criminal policies” for the baby deaths in Gaza.\nIn a statement, the group called for immediate intervention “to stop Israel’s violations of the ceasefire agreement and allow the entry of urgent shelter, heating, and medical aid supplies into Gaza to the children there.”\nAccording to Gaza’s government media office, nearly 1.5 million Palestinians have been left without home or shelter after the Israeli war.\nA ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement has been in place in Gaza since last month, pausing the Israeli war that has killed at least 48,350 people, mostly women and children, and left the enclave in ruins.\nLast November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\nIsrael also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.",

         "At least six Palestinian infants have died from hypothermia during a severe cold spell in the Gaza Strip, medical officials said.\nDr Saeed Salah, medical director of the Friends of the Patient Charitable Hospital in Gaza City, said on Tuesday that three newborns – aged between one and two days – died shortly after being admitted. Two more children also succumbed on Tuesday morning, with a sixth death reported in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.\nGaza’s civil defence agency also confirmed recording the deaths of six newborns due to the severe cold wave and lack of heating over the past week.\nSalah said his hospital’s nursery department had recently received eight cases of severe hypothermia, all requiring intensive care.\n“Doctors confirmed that these newborn babies arrived to the hospital not suffering from any particular diseases,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from the medical facility.\n“They were simply born and their family had no way to keep them warm – and this has been the case for the past few days since the cold weather struck the area,” he said.\nHamas decried the deaths of the newborns, calling them a result of Israel’s “criminal” policies. In a statement, it also urged mediators and the international community to intervene and ensure the entry of shelter and other essential humanitarian supplies into the Gaza Strip.\nThere was no immediate comment by the Israeli army.\nThe deaths of the children come as Israel continues to block the entry of temporary housing into Gaza, despite agreeing to allow it under the terms of the ceasefire agreement.\nThousands of mobile homes remain stranded at the Rafah crossing with Egypt, awaiting Israeli authorisation to enter the besieged Palestinian territory.\nAccording to the United Nations, at least eight newborns died of hypothermia in Gaza in December alone, while 74 children perished “amid the brutal conditions of winter”.\nIsraeli attacks on West Bank healthcare system\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also raised alarm over escalating attacks on healthcare facilities in the occupied West Bank.\n“We see the current flashpoints of violence, attacks on healthcare … starkly rising in the West Bank,” Dr Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the occupied Palestinian territories, told journalists during a press briefing from Gaza on Tuesday.\nBetween April and December 2024, the WHO documented 694 attacks on healthcare facilities in the West Bank.\nIsraeli military operations in the occupied West Bank have intensified in recent months, particularly in the north.\nIn Tulkarem refugee camp, Israeli forces have maintained a siege for 30 consecutive days, forcibly displacing residents.\nFaisal Salama, head of the Popular Committee for Tulkarem Camp Services, told Wafa news on Tuesday that Israeli forces had demolished at least 40 residential buildings, including 100 apartments, and set fire to at least 10 homes.\nIn Jenin, where Israel has been conducting a month-long assault, more than 20,000 people have been forcibly displaced.\nThe Jenin municipality reported this week that Israeli forces had completely demolished at least 120 homes in the city’s refugee camp.",

         "Al menos seis bebés han muerto por hipotermia en las últimas horas en Gaza, golpeada por una ola de frío polar, según la agencia de noticias Wafa, que cita fuentes sanitarias. El director del hospital benéfico Amigos del Paciente, Saeed Salah, ha declarado a la agencia Sanad que cuatro de los fallecidos (tres de ellos con tan solo dos meses de vida) murieron en Ciudad de Gaza “debido al intenso frío y a la falta de refugio” pocas horas después de su ingreso hospitalario esta madrugada.\n“Llegaron con una temperatura muy baja, como si fueran bloques de hielo, y sufrieron una caída en la circulación sanguínea, lo que afecta a todo el proceso respiratorio, así como al funcionamiento de riñones, hígado y cerebro”, ha detallado. Salah también ha informado de la muerte de un quinto bebé a primera hora de este martes identificado como Sham Yousef Al Shambari de poco más de un mes que falleció dentro de su tienda de campaña en la zona humanitaria de Al Mawasi, en el sur de la Franja. Posteriormente, las autoridades gazatíes han elevado el número de niños muertos a seis.\nEl jefe del departamento de Pediatría del hospital Nasser, Ahmed al Farra, por su parte, ha advertido de que el número de muertes entre los bebés recién nacidos seguirá creciendo, puesto que no pueden soportar la caída de las temperaturas sin “calefacción, mantas y ropa”. Además, Wafa ha informado de que al menos otros tres bebés están en estado crítico por el intenso frío. La mayoría de la población gazatí, pese a la llegada del alto el fuego, sigue malviviendo en tiendas de campaña o en refugios improvisados rodeados de escombros, sin calefacción ni recursos suficientes para poder hacer frente a estas bajas temperaturas.\nEn este sentido, el director de la Oficina de Medios del Gobierno del enclave, Ismail Al Thawabtah, ha pedido en un comunicado a los mediadores y a la comunidad internacional adoptar “medidas urgentes para proporcionar casas móviles como refugio temporal para las más de 280.000 familias palestinas que perdieron sus hogares” así como el ingreso de “combustible para dar calor y proteger a los niños inocentes”. Desde enero, al menos una decena de bebés han muerto en la Franja de hipotermia, según cifras de las autoridades palestinas. Gran parte de estas muertes se han producido en Al Mawasi, abarrotada de desplazados que también viven en tiendas de campaña tras haberse quedado sin sus casas por los bombardeos israelíes.",

Last week, Hamas threatened to postpone the scheduled release of hostages after it said Israel had delayed the promised entry of mobile homes into the devastated strip.\nHamas blamed the deaths of the newborns on Israel’s “criminal policies”, accusing Israel of obstructing humanitarian aid.\nIsrael did not immediately comment on the reports of the newborn deaths. It has consistently denied restricting aid.\nInternational aid officials have confirmed aid is getting into Gaza despite logistical problems, but they warn more is needed.\nReuters",

         "Naciones Unidas ha afirmado que existen “muchos desafíos” a la hora de enviar ayuda humanitaria en forma de tiendas de campaña, casas rodantes y lonas impermeables a la Franja de Gaza a pesar del acuerdo de alto el fuego, en vigor desde el 19 de enero, después de que se confirmara la muerte de 15 menores de edad a causa de las bajas temperaturas en el enclave palestino, sumido en una profunda crisis humanitaria a causa de la ofensiva militar de Israel.\nEl portavoz de la Secretaría General de la ONU, Stéphane Dujarric, ha indicado en rueda de prensa que “ha habido muchos desafíos a la hora de lograr la entrada de tiendas de campaña, casas rodantes y lonas impermeables”, citando a miembros de las agencias humanitarias que trabajan en la Franja.\n“Seguimos trabajando. Algunas están entrando, pero necesitamos más”, ha destacado, al tiempo que ha apuntado a una mejora de la situación de la seguridad tras el alto el fuego, lo que se ve reflejado en la ausencia de informaciones sobre “anarquía a gran escala” o ataques contra camiones con ayuda.\n“No hemos visto informes sobre una anarquía a gran escala. Si ha habido uno o dos incidentes, no he oído nada sobre ello. Nada lo suficientemente grande como para ser notificado ha sido enviado aquí”, ha señalado Dujarric, quien ha aseverado que “obviamente es mucho más seguro y más fácil entregar ayuda” a raíz del alto el fuego entre Israel y el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás).\nTe puede interesar | Trump comparte video hecho por IA con una Gaza reconstruida y Elon Musk aventando billetes\nEl director general del Ministerio de Sanidad gazatí, Munir al Barash, afirmó el martes que ya son 15 los menores que han muerto por el frío desde que comenzó el invierno, al tiempo que acusó a Israel de incumplir los protocolos humanitarios a los que había accedido en el marco del alto el fuego, lamentando por ejemplo que no hayan entrado en la Franja suficientes equipos de calefacción, tiendas de campaña o suministros médicos.\nEn la misma línea, Hamás subrayó que “la muerte de seis recién nacidos en Gaza debido al frío y la falta de calefacción, así como el ingreso en estado crítico de varios niños, es resultado de las políticas criminales del gobierno fascista de ocupación y sus obstáculos a la entrada de ayuda humanitaria y material para la construcción de refugios para más de dos millones de personas”.\nLas autoridades de Gaza, controladas por el Movimiento de Resistencia Islámica (Hamás), han cifrado en cerca de 48.350 los palestinos muertos a causa de la ofensiva militar desatada por Israel contra el enclave tras los ataques ejecutados el 7 de octubre de 2023, que dejaron unos 1.200 muertos y cerca de 250 secuestrados, según las autoridades israelíes.",

         "Οι γιατροί στη Γάζα μεταφέρουν ότι 6 μωρά πέθαναν από το κρύο στη Γάζα, καθώς οι εκτοπισμένοι στεγάζονται σε σκηνές και ερείπια, εν μέσω ενός πολύ άγριου χειμώνα, όπως μεταφέρει το Associated Press.\nΤουλάχιστον έξι βρέφη πέθαναν από υποθερμία τις τελευταίες δύο εβδομάδες στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας, όπου εκατοντάδες χιλιάδες άνθρωποι ζουν σε καταυλισμούς με σκηνές και σε κατεστραμμένα από τον πόλεμο κτίρια κατά τη διάρκεια μιας εύθραυστης εκεχειρίας, δήλωσαν την Τρίτη Παλαιστίνιοι γιατροί.\nΤο παράκτιο έδαφος βιώνει κρύους, υγρούς χειμώνες, με θερμοκρασίες που πέφτουν κάτω από τους 10 βαθμούς Κελσίου τη νύχτα και καταιγίδες που φυσούν από τη Μεσόγειο Θάλασσα. Οι τελευταίες ημέρες ήταν ιδιαίτερα ψυχρές.\nΟ Γιουσούφ αλ-Σινμπάρι ξύπνησε στη σκηνή της οικογένειάς του λίγο μετά τα μεσάνυχτα της Τρίτης για να διαπιστώσει ότι η 2 μηνών κόρη του, Σαμ, ήταν κρύα στην αφή. Δεν μπορούσε να αισθανθεί καρδιακό παλμό. «Χθες, έπαιζα μαζί της», είπε. «Ήμουν χαρούμενος μαζί της. Ήταν ένα όμορφο παιδί, σαν το φεγγάρι». Βίντεο που μεταδόθηκε στα RT και Middle East Eye, δείχνει την 2 μηνών Σαμ που ονοματίζεται στη μαρτυρία. Αν το αναζητήσετε μην το δείτε.\nΠεθαίνουν παιδιά από τα κρυπαγήματα μέσα στις σκηνές – 15 επιβεβαιωμένα\nΟ Δρ Αχμέντ αλ-Φαράχ, επικεφαλής του παιδιατρικού τμήματος του νοσοκομείου Νάσερ στην περιοχή Χαν Γιουνίς, όπου μεταφέρθηκε η σορός της, δήλωσε ότι δεν είχε κάποια ασθένεια αλλά πέθανε από το έντονο κρύο επειδή βρισκόταν σε μια σκηνή. Είπε ότι το νοσοκομείο περιέθαλψε άλλα δύο βρέφη για κρυοπαγήματα.\nΟ Σαέντ Σαλάχ , του Νοσοκομείου Φίλων των Ασθενών στην πόλη της Γάζας, δήλωσε ότι πέντε βρέφη ηλικίας ενός μηνός ή μικρότερα πέθαναν από το κρύο τις τελευταίες δύο εβδομάδες, συμπεριλαμβανομένου ενός βρέφους 1 μηνός που πέθανε τη Δευτέρα. Είπε ότι ένα άλλο παιδί έχει τεθεί σε αναπνευστήρα.\nΟ Ζαχέρ αλ Γουχεντί, επικεφαλής του τμήματος αρχείων του Υπουργείου Υγείας της Γάζας, δήλωσε ότι έχει καταγράψει 15 θανάτους από υποθερμία αυτόν τον χειμώνα, όλοι τους παιδιά.\nΗ κατάπαυση του πυρός που διέκοψε 16 μήνες πολέμου μεταξύ του Ισραήλ και των μαχητών της Χαμάς επέτρεψε την αύξηση της ανθρωπιστικής βοήθειας, κυρίως τροφίμων, αλλά οι κάτοικοι λένε ότι εξακολουθούν να υπάρχουν ελλείψεις σε κουβέρτες και ζεστά ρούχα και ελάχιστα ξύλα για τις φωτιές.\nΟι άνθρωποι ζουν στα ερείπια\nΑπό τις πρώτες ημέρες του πολέμου δεν υπάρχει κεντρική ηλεκτροδότηση στη Γάζα και τα καύσιμα για τις γεννήτριες είναι ελάχιστα. Πολλές οικογένειες συνωστίζονται στην υγρή άμμο ή στο γυμνό τσιμέντο.\n«Κάνει απίστευτο κρύο», δήλωσε νωρίτερα αυτό το μήνα η Ροζαλία Μπόλεν, εκπρόσωπος της υπηρεσίας των Ηνωμένων Εθνών για τα παιδιά. «Δεν έχω ιδέα πώς οι άνθρωποι μπορούν να κοιμούνται τη νύχτα στις αυτοσχέδιες σκηνές τους».\nΗ στρατιωτική επίθεση του Ισραήλ, που ξεκίνησε ως απάντηση στην επίθεση της Χαμάς στις 7 Οκτωβρίου 2023, ήταν από τις πιο θανατηφόρες και καταστροφικές στην πρόσφατη ιστορία.\nΚατέστρεψε μεγάλες περιοχές της Γάζας σε ερείπια. Οι εκατοντάδες χιλιάδες άνθρωποι που μπόρεσαν να επιστρέψουν στη βόρεια Γάζα στο πλαίσιο της κατάπαυσης του πυρός εγκαταστάθηκαν όπου μπορούσαν μέσα στα ερείπια.\nΛήγει η πρώτη φάση της κατάπαυσης του πυρός στη Γάζα\nΗ πρώτη φάση της κατάπαυσης του πυρός λήγει το Σάββατο και δεν μπορεί να παραταθεί. Εάν οι μάχες επαναληφθούν, η τρέχουσα ροή ανθρωπιστικής βοήθειας αναμένεται να μειωθεί δραματικά.\nΑκόμη και αν η εκεχειρία διαρκέσει, δεν είναι σαφές πότε θα ξαναχτιστεί οτιδήποτε στη Γάζα. Η Παγκόσμια Τράπεζα έχει εκτιμήσει το κόστος της ανοικοδόμησης σε πάνω από 50 δισεκατομμύρια δολάρια και μπορεί να χρειαστούν χρόνια μόνο για να καθαριστούν τα ερείπια.\nΗ Χαμάς κατηγόρησε το Ισραήλ ότι καθυστερεί την είσοδο κινητών κατοικιών και σκηνών κατά παράβαση της εκεχειρίας. Το Ισραήλ αρνείται τους ισχυρισμούς και κατηγορεί τη Χαμάς για παραβίαση της συμφωνίας.\nΤο Ισραήλ καθυστέρησε την απελευθέρωση εκατοντάδων Παλαιστίνιων κρατουμένων το περασμένο Σαββατοκύριακο κατηγορώντας τη Χαμάς πως «παρελαύνει τους ομήρους ενώπιον πλήθους σε δημόσια θεάματα κατά τη διάρκεια της απελευθέρωσής τους».\nΟΗΕ: Πρέπει να επιτραπεί η μεταφορά περισσότερων καταφυγίων στη Γάζα\nΟ Στεφάν Ντούτζαριτς , εκπρόσωπος του Γενικού Γραμματέα του ΟΗΕ Αντόνιο Γκουτέρες, δηλώνει ότι περισσότερες προσωρινές κατοικίες και άλλα καταφύγια που εμποδίζονται από το Ισραήλ πρέπει να φτάσουν στον ταλαιπωρημένο λαό της Γάζας.\nΤα σχόλια έρχονται μετά τον θάνατο τουλάχιστον έξι βρεφών από υποθερμία κατά τη διάρκεια μιας περιόδου έντονου ψύχους στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας.\n«Η κατανόησή μου από τους συναδέλφους μας που ασχολούνται με την ανθρωπιστική βοήθεια είναι ότι υπήρξαν πολλές προκλήσεις για να φτάσουν σκηνές, τροχόσπιτα και μουσαμάδες. Συνεχίζουμε να πιέζουμε. Κάποια μπαίνουν, αλλά χρειαζόμαστε περισσότερα», δήλωσε ο Ντούτζαριτς στους δημοσιογράφους.\nΟ θάνατος των παιδιών έρχεται καθώς το Ισραήλ συνεχίζει να εμποδίζει την είσοδο προσωρινών καταλυμάτων στη Γάζα, παρά το γεγονός ότι συμφώνησε να το επιτρέψει βάσει των όρων της συμφωνίας κατάπαυσης του πυρός με τη Χαμάς. Δεκάδες χιλιάδες κινητές κατοικίες παραμένουν εγκλωβισμένες στο πέρασμα της Ράφα με την Αίγυπτο περιμένοντας την ισραηλινή άδεια.",

         "Minst seks babyer og småbarn har dødd på Gazastripen de siste to ukene som følge av nedkjøling, sier palestinsk helsepersonell.\nVintrene er kjølige og fuktige i det krigsherjede territoriet der hundretusener av fordrevne bor i telt og i ruiner av bombede og sønderskutte hus.\nOm natten er temperaturen under 10 grader, og stormene blåser inn fra Middelhavet. De siste dagene har vært spesielt kalde.\nKald og livløs toåring\nYusuf al-Shinbari våknet like etter midnatt tirsdag i teltet familien hans bor i. Da han rørte ved den to år gamle datteren Sham, var hun kald og livløs. Han fant ingen puls.\n– I går lekte jeg med henne. Jeg var lykkelig sammen med henne. Hun var et vakkert barn, som månen, sier faren.\nOverlege Ahmed al-Farah ved barneavdelingen på Nasser-sykehuset i Khan Younis, dit den døde jenta ble tatt med, sier toåringen ikke var syk. Fordi hun bodde i et telt, døde hun av den strenge kulden. Legen sier to andre spedbarn har fått behandling for frostskader.\nSaeed Salah ved et annet sykehus i Gaza by sier fem spedbarn som var en måned eller yngre, har dødd som følge av kulden de siste to ukene. Ytterligere ett barn ble lagt i respirator.\nSaher al-Wahedi i helsedepartementet i Gaza sier de har registrert 15 dødsfall som følge av nedkjøling denne vinteren. Alle de døde var barn.\nMangler tepper og varme klær\nVåpenhvilen mellom Israel og Hamas har ført til en kraftig økning i nødhjelpsleveransene til det krigsherjede territoriet. Det er først og fremst mat som kommer inn. Innbyggerne sier det fortsatt er mangel på tepper og varme klær, og det er lite ved å fyre med.\nDen sentrale strømforsyningen forsvant allerede i de første dagene etter krigsutbruddet i oktober 2023. Drivstoff til aggregater er vanskelig å få tak. Mange familier trenger seg sammen rett på betongen eller på fuktig sand.\n– Det er utrolig kaldt. Jeg skjønner ikke hvordan folk klarer å sove om natten i teltene, sa talsperson Rosalia Bollen i Unicef tidligere denne måneden.\nMangler det meste\nRundt 600.000 palestinere har ifølge FN vendt tilbake til Nord-Gaza. En av dem er sykepleier Rawya Tamboura, som har vært fordrevet det meste av tiden under den 16 måneder lange krigen. Nå er hun endelig tilbake i det bombeødelagte huset sitt.\nFamilien har verken rennende vann, strøm, varme eller andre basistjenester. Og de har ingen redskaper til å fjerne ruinene rundt seg.\nEtter den første lettelsen og gleden over å være tilbake i hjemmene sine, står de hjemvendte nå overfor realiteten av å måtte leve i ruinene i overskuelig fremtid.\n– Noen føler at det ville vært bedre å bli drept, sier Tamboura. – Jeg vet ikke hva vi skal gjøre på lang sikt. Hjernen min har sluttet å planlegge for fremtiden, legger hun til.\n50 millioner tonn ruiner\nGaza er fylt med over 50 millioner tonn ruiner, og ifølge FN vil det trengs 100 lastebiler som jobber for fullt i over 15 år for å fjerne ruinene.\nGaza bys kommune har begynt å reparere noen av vannledningene og fjerne noen av ruinhaugene fra gatene, ifølge talsmann Asem Alnabih. Men han forteller at de mangler tungt utstyr.\n– Bare noen få av kommunens 40 bulldosere og fem lastebiler fungerer fortsatt, opplyser Alnabih.",

         "En la Franja de Gaza, el frío también mata. Al menos seis bebés murieron de hipotermia en las últimas dos semanas en el territorio palestino, aseguró Mahmoud Bassal, portavoz de la Defensa Civil de Gaza.\n“Debido a una intensa ola de frío y a la falta de calefacción, hemos registrado la muerte de seis recién nacidos en la última semana hasta hoy”, indicó Bassal a la agencia de noticias AFP.\nUna ola de frío golpea a la Franja de Gaza desde hace dos semanas, con temperaturas que han descendido hasta los cero grados Celsius.\nEl último niño falleció el lunes 24 de febrero en el Hospital Amigos del Paciente de Gaza, donde en las últimas dos semanas ya habían perdido la vida por frío otros cuatro bebés, relató su director, Said Salah.\nPor otro lado, Zaher al Waheidi, director de la unidad en el Ministerio de Sanidad a cargo del recuento de fallecidos, confirmó que el cadáver de un sexto niño llegó el Hospital Nasser de Khan Yunis, en el sur del enclave.\n\"Sin calefacción, mantas ni ropa”\nSaid Salah, director del Hospital Amigos del Paciente, explicó que se observa un aumento del ingreso de bebés en el centro hospitalario, debido a la ola de frío.\n“En las últimas dos semanas hemos tenido un aumento de los ingresos por frío de bebés. En dos semanas hemos tenido nueve casos\", contó Said Salah, alertando que los menores llegaron al centro con dificultades respiratorias, baja presión sanguínea y extremidades frías.\nTres mejoraron, mientras que el último sigue en la unidad de cuidados intensivos en estado crítico.\nEn total, 15 niños han muerto como consecuencia del frío desde el comienzo del invierno, indicó el doctor Muneer Alboursh, director general de Salud en Gaza.\nSeñaló que los hospitales de Gaza, en particular los hospitales infantiles, ya no pueden tratar los casos que llegan, ya sea debido a su destrucción por la ocupación o a la devastación de sus instalaciones y equipos.\nPor otra parte, el jefe del Departamento de Pediatría del Hospital Nasser, Ahmed al Farra, avisó de que el número de muertes entre los bebés recién nacidos seguirá creciendo, dado que no pueden soportar la caída de las temperaturas \"sin calefacción, mantas ni ropa”.\nVivir en carpas que no protegen del frío\nLa vulnerabilidad de los niños gazatíes se puede explicar por la falta de alojamiento que se les permite protegerse del frío.\nSi bien el alto al fuego en vigor entre Hamás e Israel desde hace más de un mes ha permitido una mayor entrada de la ayuda humanitaria en la Franja de Gaza, cientos de miles de personas siguen viviendo en carpas, refugios improvisados, o casas destruidas por los bombardeos, y, por supuesto, sin calefacción.\nSegún la Oficina de Medios del enclave, más de 280.000 familias palestinas no tienen hogar y no pueden enfrentar las temperaturas bajas.\nEn este sentido, su director Ismail al Thawabtah, pidió a la comunidad internacional “adoptar medidas urgentes para proporcionar casas móviles como refugio temporal para las más de 280.000 familias palestinas que perdieron sus hogares” y el ingreso de “combustible para dar calor y proteger a los niños inocentes”.\n“La muerte de seis recién nacidos en la Franja de Gaza (...) es el resultado de las políticas criminales del gobierno de ocupación fascista y de su impedimento a la entrada de ayuda humanitaria y materiales de refugio para más de dos millones de ciudadanos, mientras la comunidad internacional continúa en silencio al abordar la catástrofe humanitaria”, denunció Hamás en un comunicado.\nA finales del año pasado, la Agencia de Naciones Unidas para los Refugiados Palestinos (UNWRA) contabilizaba 14.500 niños muertos en Gaza desde el inicio de la guerra.",

         "Dr. Saeed Salah, the medical director of the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital (PFBS), northern Gaza, warned of a “disaster” in the rising number of babies suffering from hypothermia, as they try to survive winter conditions in the strip.\nIn the past two weeks, eight babies with hypothermia were admitted to the medical facility in Gaza City, said Dr. Salah. Of those, three were admitted to the intensive care unit, and three others died “within hours” of arrival.\nThen on Tuesday, a fourth baby who was just 69 days old died overnight, Dr. Salah added. Further south, two other babies died with hypothermia symptoms in Nasser Hospital, Khan Younis, health workers there told journalists.\nDr. Salah said more caravans, tents and fuel were needed to “bring warmth to the people.” He added that such provisions would stop this kind of “catastrophe from repeating itself” and “prevent the death of neonatal babies from hypothermia and frostbite.”\nA fragile ceasefire has offered a moment of reprieve for people in Gaza from Israel’s months-long military campaign that it launched in response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and saw more than 250 taken hostage.\nAt least 48,348 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and another 111,761 people injured, the Ministry of Health there reported on Tuesday.\nSurvivors say they are struggling to rebuild communities and reconcile the destruction wrought – which gutted the medical system, and spawned a crisis of starvation, displacement and disease. Just 20 out of 35 hospitals are partially functional, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nHamas has repeatedly accused Israel of preventing the entry of humanitarian aid into the strip in violation of the ceasefire agreement – accusations that Israel has denied.\nOn February 14, COGAT said that 4,200 humanitarian aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip that week, carrying food, fuel, medical supplies, tents and shelter equipment, in compliance with the ceasefire and hostage deal. Since the start of the ceasefire on January 19, 16,800 trucks of aid had entered Gaza, COGAT added.\n‘Man-made crisis’\nIn Nasser Hospital, a Palestinian mother gently stroked her tiny, pale baby, who was swaddled in blankets. Two-month-old Yousaf Al-Najjar is one of many neonatal patients being treated for hypothermia there.\nCNN footage from the hospital on Tuesday showed the mother trying to check the temperature of her baby boy, who she said has become like “a skeleton.” The family is displaced inside a tent nearby, with at least 15 other relatives.\n“I put my lips on his face and feet, and they have become frozen,” she told CNN. “Children are being brought in dead from the cold weather.\n“We don’t have covers or anything,” she added. “I see death in my son.”\nBaby Yousaf was born prematurely, according to Dr. Fida’a Al-Nadi, a pediatrician at Nasser Hospital. His weight of two kilograms has made him more vulnerable to hypothermia, Dr Al-Nadi told CNN.\n“Every day we are dealing with children (suffering) hypothermia, many of them die,” she said on Tuesday. “The problem is not the hospital; it’s the conditions where the children are living, either in tents or destroyed homes.”\nIsrael’s war in Gaza has pushed many Palestinians into tent camps. At least 1.9 million people have been displaced, according to the UN. Many have sought refuge in sprawling outdoor areas, living for months in makeshift tents made of cloth and nylon – with little access to warmth, electricity or heating. In cold weather conditions, newborns and children up to three months are among those most at risk of respiratory infections, lack of blood supply, and infections, Dr Munir Al-Bursh, the director general of the health ministry in the enclave, said on February 19.\nFikr Shalltoot, the Gaza director for the UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians, said the deaths of those six Palestinian babies “is the direct result of Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid.”\n“Newborns should not be dying of hypothermia in Gaza. This is not a tragedy of nature but a man-made crisis,” Shalltoot said on Tuesday, in a statement shared with CNN. “If adequate aid, including shelter supplies, were allowed to reach civilians and hospitals, these deaths would be entirely preventable.”",

         "Local medical professionals said Tuesday that at least half a dozen babies have died this week in Gaza amid winter weather and Israel's ongoing blockade of the obliterated Palestinian enclave, where hundreds of thousands of people are living in tent encampments and other unheated makeshift structures.\nDr. Saeed Salah, the medical director at Patients' Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in Gaza City, told reporters that three infants died on Monday and three more on Tuesday from complications due to exposure to the cold.\n\"In the past two weeks, we admitted eight newborns suffering from severe cold injuries,\" Salah said. \"Three of them died within hours of arrival. They were only a day or two old, weighing between 1.7 and 2 kilograms (3.7-4.4 lbs.).\"\n\"All of these children arrived with low temperatures, shortness of breath, and cold extremities that reached the point of freezing,\" Salah toldThe Washington Post by phone Tuesday. \"These children live with their families in tents and destroyed homes and suffer from a lack of supplies that help provide them with the necessary warmth, especially with the Israeli intransigence in bringing in the necessary fuel.\"\nGaza experiences cold, wet, and windy winters, with temperatures often dipping well below 50°F (10°C) at night. Hypothermia can be deadly at temperatures over 60°F (15°C) in overexposed conditions such as those existing in Gaza, where the overwhelming majority of the strip's 2.3 million residents have been forcibly displaced, most homes have been destroyed or damaged, and bodies have been weakened from more than 500 days of an Israeli siege for which the country is facing genocide charges at the International Court of Justice.\nThe sixth reported infant death of the week was of 2-month-old Sham Yousef al-Shanbari, who died in her family's tent in the Mawasi area of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n\"Her body turned into a piece of ice... and her heartbeat stopped,\" uncle-in-law Obaida al-Shanbari told the Post by phone Tuesday.\nYusuf al-Shanbari, Sham's father, toldThe Associated Press: \"Yesterday, I was playing with her. I was happy with her. She was a beautiful child, like the moon.\"\n(Warning: The following video contains images of death.m)\nDr. Ahmed al-Farah, the head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told the AP that al-Shanbari did not have any illness but died from exposure because she lived in a tent. Al-Farah also said the hospital has treated two other infants for frostbite.\nAt least three Palestinian infants died from exposure to cold conditions earlier this winter, when Israeli forces were still carrying out their assault on Gaza that left more than 170,000 people dead, wounded, or missing.\nHamas, whose political wing rules the Gaza Strip, has accused Israel of violating the terms of a fragile monthlong cease-fire, not only by killing and wounding Palestinian civilians and postponing a scheduled prisoner release, but also by delaying the delivery of mobile homes, tents, and other lifesaving humanitarian aid. Israeli officials deny the allegations.\n\"If adequate aid, including shelter supplies, were allowed to reach civilians and hospitals, these deaths would be entirely preventable.\"\n\"Newborns should not be dying of hypothermia in Gaza. This is not a tragedy of nature but a man-made crisis,\" Fikr Shalltoot, Gaza director for the London-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, told the Post.\n\"If adequate aid, including shelter supplies, were allowed to reach civilians and hospitals, these deaths would be entirely preventable,\" Shalltoot added. \"This suffering is the direct result of Israel's restrictions on essential humanitarian aid.\"\nEdward Ahmed Mitchell, deputy executive director at the Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement Tuesday: \"The Israeli government's genocidal campaign in Gaza has left most of its population homeless. To block the entry of temporary housing so that returning Palestinians, including infants, die of exposure is entirely unconscionable.\"\n\"The Trump administration and the international community must take immediate action to force the Israeli government to allow desperately needed housing supplies to enter Gaza,\" Mitchell added.",

         "At least six babies have frozen to death over the past two weeks in Gaza, amid a continued blockade of fuel and humanitarian aid by the illegal Israeli occupation.\nDoctors at the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City said that five infants had died in their hospital alone from hypothermia over this period.\n“The last several weeks we [had] nine neonates in our hospital. And they came with a case that they call ‘cold injury’ or hypothermia,” Dr. Samer Lubad, a pediatrician at the hospital, told Al Jazeera.\n“Three babies survived and were treated successfully and discharged home. There is still one baby in our neonatal ICU in a critical general condition,” he added. “Of course, this condition is because of the cold weather and lack of safe shelters, lack of central heating, and lack of electricity in the Gaza Strip.”\nOvernight Monday, a two-month-old girl froze to death in Khan Younis, the head of the pediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said.\nThe girl, Sham Yousef al-Shambari, was buried by her father and uncle after her mother found her “stiff as wood from the cold” in their family’s tent.\nObaida al-Shanbari, the girl’s uncle, said that “Her body turned into a piece of ice … and her heartbeat stopped,” in a phone interview with the Washington Post.\nMuneer al-Boursh, a director general of the Gaza health ministry, said in a statement that 15 children had frozen to death over the winter.\nHe said that Israel had “failed to comply with humanitarian protocols, including allowing the entry of medical equipment, heating supplies, tents, and mobile homes” agreed to as part of the ceasefire that began on January 19.\nThe vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.1 million people has been displaced multiple times and 70 percent of buildings in the enclave have been destroyed or damaged.\nOver the past two weeks, temperatures have repeatedly dropped to as low as 3 degrees Celsius.\nOnly half of Gaza’s hospitals are even partially functional and all face shortages of energy, supplies and critical equipment.\n“Newborns should not be dying of hypothermia in Gaza. This is not a tragedy of nature but a man-made crisis,” Fikr Shalltoot, Gaza director for the London-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, told the Washington Post.\nShe added, “If adequate aid, including shelter supplies, were allowed to reach civilians and hospitals, these deaths would be entirely preventable. This suffering is the direct result of Israel’s restrictions on essential humanitarian aid.”\nSaeed Salah, director of the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in northern Gaza, told the Washington Post, “All of these children arrived with low temperatures, shortness of breath, and cold extremities that reached the point of freezing.”\n“These children live with their families in tents and destroyed homes and suffer from a lack of supplies that help provide them with the necessary warmth, especially with the Israeli intransigence in bringing in the necessary fuel,” Salah said.\n“My children are in pain and I’m helpless. I cannot afford to buy them clothes or blankets,” Manal Alsosi, a refugee in Gaza, told Al Jazeera. “A tent does not protect you from the cold or the rain in winter. We are suffering day and night,” she said.\n“The cold weather has a catastrophic impact on hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in tents and temporary shelters, especially with the lack of heating and basic supplies to protect against rain and strong winds,” Hosni Mahna, a spokesperson for the Gaza municipality, told Al Jazeera.\nHe added, “There is an acute shortage of tents. In the Gaza and North governorates alone, we need at least 120,000 tents to temporarily shelter residents who have lost their homes, but what has been delivered so far covers only 10 percent of the actual need.”\nHanan Balkhy, regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean at the World Health Organization, said in a statement that “The health system is ruined. Malnutrition is rising. The risk of famine persists. … We are ready to scale up our response, but we urgently need systematic and sustained access to the population across Gaza, and we need an end to restrictions on the entry of essential supplies.”\nResponding to the deaths of the infants, Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, demanded that Israel allow housing and fuel into the Gaza Strip. “My understanding from our humanitarian colleagues is that there’s been a lot of challenges in getting tents and caravans and tarpaulins in. We continue to push. Some are going in but we need more.”\nThe horrific revelations of infant deaths come amid continued revelations of the systematic torture of doctors and medical staff by Israeli officials.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, 63-year-old Abu Ajwa, a doctor at al-Ahli Arab hospital in central Gaza, said he was systematically tortured for months by Israeli officials. “There was a bathroom [in the interrogation room] … [they] would take a toilet brush and tell me ‘today we are going to brush your teeth.’ I was tied up, blindfolded and three or four of them held my face, pinned it down and kept scrubbing.”\nSince the start of the Gaza genocide, over 1,000 medical staff have been killed amid the systematic destruction of Gaza’s medical system.\nAt the same time, Israeli forces continue to rampage throughout Gaza, with at least 50 Palestinians killed in the West Bank since January 21.\nThe Israeli army, which is carrying out military operations in the Jenin refugee camp, is blocking residents from returning to their homes, effectively expanding the mass displacement in Gaza to portions of the West Bank.\nA statement from Human Rights Watch (HRW) condemned the ongoing displacement of Palestinians from sections of the West Bank, declaring, “States should act to prevent atrocities and allow Palestinians to return to their homes.”\nEarlier this month, US President Donald Trump called for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza’s Palestinian population. He declared that the Gaza Strip “should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that lived a miserable existence there.” Trump called for “other countries” to “build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza.”\nLast week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz ordered the creation of a directorate in the Defense Ministry tasked with overseeing the implementation of Trump’s proposal. “The plan includes extensive assistance that will allow any Gaza resident who wants to emigrate to a third state to receive support, including special departure arrangements through sea, air, and land,” the Defense Ministry stated.",

         "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — At least six infants have died from hypothermia in the last two weeks in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of people are living in tent camps and war-damaged buildings during a fragile ceasefire, Palestinian medics said Tuesday.\nTemperatures have plunged in recent days. The coastal territory experiences cold, wet winters, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night and storms blowing in from the Mediterranean Sea.\nDr. Ahmed al-Farah, head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told The Associated Press that it received the body of a 2-month-old girl on Tuesday. He said another two infants were treated for frostbite, with one of them discharged later.\nSaeed Saleh, of the Patient's Friends Hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger have died from the cold over the last two weeks, including a 1-month-old who died on Monday. He said another child has been placed on a ventilator.\nZaher al-Wahedi, head of the Gaza Health Ministry's records department, said it has recorded 15 deaths from hypothermia this winter, all of them children.\nThe ceasefire that paused 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas militants has allowed a surge in humanitarian aid, mainly food, but residents say there are still shortages of blankets and warm clothing, and little wood available for fires.\nThere's been no central electricity in Gaza since the first few days of the war, and fuel for generators is scarce. Many families huddle on damp sand or bare concrete.\n“It’s incredibly cold,” Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for the United Nations children's agency, said earlier this month. “I have no clue how people can sleep at night in their makeshift tents.”\nIsrael's military offensive, launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, was among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history. It pounded large areas of Gaza into rubble. The hundreds of thousands of people who have been able to return to northern Gaza under the ceasefire have settled wherever they can amid the ruins.\nThe ceasefire's first phase will end on Saturday and may not be extended. If fighting resumes, the current flow of humanitarian aid is expected to drop dramatically.\nEven if the truce endures, it's unclear when anything in Gaza will be rebuilt. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction at over $50 billion, and it could take years just to clear the rubble.\nIsrael blames the destruction on Hamas because the militants positioned tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure in residential areas.\nHamas has accused Israel of delaying the entry of mobile homes and tents in violation of the ceasefire. Israel denies the allegations and accuses Hamas of violating the agreement. Israel held up the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners last weekend to protest Hamas' practice of parading hostages before crowds in public spectacles during their release.\nHamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted around 250 hostages. Over 60 are still held in Gaza, around half believed to be dead.\nIsrael's air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many of those killed were militants. Israel says it killed over 17,000 fighters but has not provided evidence.\n___\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\nStory Continues",

         "Several Palestinian children, including a newborn girl, have died due to severe cold weather in Gaza as Israel continues to deliberately deny or obstruct the delivery of tents and mobile homes into the territory.\nAt least six children died overnight from hypothermia in Gaza, according to the local health authorities, who said one of the victims, a baby girl called Sham, was just a few days old.\nFive of the children, they said, died in the Friends of the Patient Hospital in the Remal neighborhood of Gaza City, while the sixth child succumbed to winter weather in the southern city of Khan Younis.\nTens of thousands of Palestinians are living in tents placed on the rubble of their destroyed homes across Gaza, where the temperatures can fall to 6C at this time of year.\nHamas said in a statement that the children died as a result of Israel’s “criminal policies,” and “its prevention of the entry of humanitarian aid and shelter materials” for more than two million people.\nThe children’s death, it said, took place at a time “when the international community continues its silence on addressing the unprecedented humanitarian disaster” unfolding in Gaza as a result of the Israeli “aggression and siege.”\nDespite a ceasefire agreement that took effect more than a month ago, Israel still largely blocks the entry of various essential items into the besieged territory, including tents, mobile homes, and heavy machinery necessary to clear rubble and retrieve bodies.\nUnder the ceasefire deal, Israel must allow some 600 trucks a day of aid to enter the besieged Palestinian territory.\nHamas demanded that the mediators— Qatar and Egypt— take immediate action to stop the regime’s “violation of the ceasefire agreement, oblige it to implement the humanitarian protocol associated with it, and ensure the entry of shelter, heating and urgent medical aid supplies” to Gaza.\nPalestinian officials have repeatedly warned that the Gaza ceasefire deal is at risk of collapse, as the regime of Benjamin Netanyahu is deliberately blocking aid and reconstruction efforts to push Palestinians out of their homeland.",

         "Vintrene er kjølige og fuktige i det krigsherjede territoriet der hundretusener av fordrevne bor i telt og i ruiner av bombede og sønderskutte hus.\nOm natten er temperaturen under 10 grader, og stormene blåser inn fra Middelhavet. De siste dagene har vært spesielt kalde.\nKald og livløs toåring\nYusuf al-Shinbari våknet like etter midnatt tirsdag i teltet familien hans bor i. Da han rørte ved den to år gamle datteren Sham, var hun kald og livløs. Han fant ingen puls.\n– I går lekte jeg med henne. Jeg var lykkelig sammen med henne. Hun var et vakkert barn, som månen, sier faren.\nOverlege Ahmed al-Farah ved barneavdelingen på Nasser-sykehuset i Khan Younis, dit den døde jenta ble tatt med, sier toåringen ikke var syk. Fordi hun bodde i et telt, døde hun av den strenge kulden. Legen sier to andre spedbarn har fått behandling for frostskader.\nSaeed Salah ved et annet sykehus i Gaza by sier fem spedbarn som var en måned eller yngre, har dødd som følge av kulden de siste to ukene. Ytterligere ett barn ble lagt i respirator.\nSaher al-Wahedi i helsedepartementet i Gaza sier de har registrert 15 dødsfall som følge av nedkjøling denne vinteren. Alle de døde var barn.\nMangler tepper og varme klær\nVåpenhvilen mellom Israel og Hamas har ført til en kraftig økning i nødhjelpsleveransene til det krigsherjede territoriet. Det er først og fremst mat som kommer inn. Innbyggerne sier det fortsatt er mangel på tepper og varme klær, og det er lite ved å fyre med.\nDen sentrale strømforsyningen forsvant allerede i de første dagene etter krigsutbruddet i oktober 2023. Drivstoff til aggregater er vanskelig å få tak. Mange familier trenger seg sammen rett på betongen eller på fuktig sand.\n– Det er utrolig kaldt.

         "DEIR AL BALAH, — At least six infants have died from hypothermia in the last two weeks in the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of people are living in tent camps and war-damaged buildings during a fragile ceasefire, Palestinian medics said Tuesday.\nTemperatures have plunged in recent days. The coastal territory experiences cold, wet winters, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night and storms blowing in from the Mediterranean Sea.\nDr. Ahmed al-Farah, head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, told The Associated Press that it received the body of a 2-month-old girl on Tuesday. He said another two infants were treated for frostbite, with one of them discharged later.\nSaeed Saleh, of the Patient's Friends Hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger have died from the cold over the last two weeks, including a 1-month-old who died on Monday. He said another child has been placed on a ventilator.\nZaher al-Wahedi, head of the Gaza Health Ministry's records department, said it has recorded 15 deaths from hypothermia this winter, all of them children.\nThe ceasefire that paused 16 months of war between Israel and Hamas militants has allowed a surge in humanitarian aid, mainly food, but residents say there are still shortages of blankets and warm clothing, and little wood available for fires.\nThere's been no central electricity in Gaza since the first few days of the war, and fuel for generators is scarce. Many families huddle on damp sand or bare concrete.\n“It’s incredibly cold,” Rosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for the United Nations children's agency, said earlier this month. “I have no clue how people can sleep at night in their makeshift tents.”\nIsrael's military offensive, launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack, was among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history. It pounded large areas of Gaza into rubble. The hundreds of thousands of people who have been able to return to northern Gaza under the ceasefire have settled wherever they can amid the ruins.\nThe ceasefire's first phase will end on Saturday and may not be extended. If fighting resumes, the current flow of humanitarian aid is expected to drop dramatically.\nEven if the truce endures, it's unclear when anything in Gaza will be rebuilt. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction at over $50 billion, and it could take years just to clear the rubble.\nIsrael blames the destruction on Hamas because the militants positioned tunnels, rocket launchers and other military infrastructure in residential areas.\nHamas has accused Israel of delaying the entry of mobile homes and tents in violation of the ceasefire. Israel denies the allegations and accuses Hamas of violating the agreement. Israel held up the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners last weekend to protest Hamas' practice of parading hostages before crowds in public spectacles during their release.\nHamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted around 250 hostages. Over 60 are still held in Gaza, around half believed to be dead.\nIsrael's air and ground war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many of those killed were militants. Israel says it killed over 17,000 fighters but has not provided evidence.",

         "Health Crisis Deepens Amid Winter Conditions\nIn the past two weeks, there have been reports of at least six infant deaths in Gaza attributed to the frigid temperatures and inadequate living conditions, according to health officials and medical personnel in the region.\nMedical Reports from Gaza Hospitals\nDoctors from the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society hospital in northern Gaza City mentioned that nine newborn infants suffering from cold-related ailments were admitted, with five fatalities confirmed and one other infant in critical condition.\nA particular incident involved a two-month-old girl who was reported to have succumbed to the cold near Khan Younis, which further highlights the alarming situation.\nUrgent Need for Assistance\nThe hospital has issued a plea for immediate delivery of caravans and heating fuel to assist the nearly 945,000 displaced individuals residing in temporary shelters and tents, which are ill-equipped for winter weather.\nThe Palestinian group Hamas has criticized Israel for not allowing sufficient supplies, including tents and shelter materials, during a previously agreed-upon ceasefire that has been in effect for several weeks. However, Israel has disputed these claims.\nImpact of the Ongoing Conflict\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in widespread displacement, affecting a large portion of Gaza’s 2.1 million inhabitants, with reports indicating that nearly 70% of infrastructure in the area has been damaged or destroyed.\nCompounding these challenges, Gaza’s healthcare system is currently struggling, with only 18 out of 35 hospitals partially operational and facing severe shortages of medical supplies.\nWeather Conditions and Medical Observations\nRecent meteorological data suggests nighttime temperatures in Gaza have frequently dipped below 10°C (50°F) over recent weeks, with a sharp drop to 3°C (37°F) recorded on Monday night.\nDr. Saeed Salah, the medical director at the PFBS hospital, expressed concern in a statement where he noted that three critically ill newborns had died from cold-related conditions, including hypothermia.\nInfants admitted to the hospital were reported to range in weight between 1.7 kg and 2 kg (approximately 3.7 to 4.4 lbs) and were either one or two days old at the time of admission. The situation remains dire as medical staff work tirelessly to care for the vulnerable neonates.\nWidespread Tragedy and Accountability\nDr. Muneer al-Boursh, who oversees the Hamas-run health ministry, reported that a total of 15 children have perished due to the cold since winter began. He accused Israel of failing to comply with necessary humanitarian protocols, including allowing medical supplies and heating provisions into Gaza.\nFurthermore, concerns continue regarding the execution of humanitarian agreements made during ongoing ceasefire negotiations, with increasing uncertainty about whether these discussions will yield effective results.\nAs the tragedy unfolds, both humanitarian aid sources and residents of Gaza are left grappling with the consequences of inadequate shelter and worsening conditions during the harsh winter months.",

         "At least six newborn babies have died from hypothermia in the Gaza Strip as temperatures continue to remain low.\nDr Saeed Saleh, a health official at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society Hospital (PFBS) in the enclave, revealed on Tuesday that eight newborns were admitted with severe cold-related injuries over the last two weeks, with six later dying.\nThree newborns, aged one and two days old, died shortly after being admitted, while a 60-day-old baby froze to death inside a tent in al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, and medical sources told Al Jazeera two more succumbed to the cold.\nPFBS has put out an urgent appeal following an increase in child injuries related to the cold and deaths related to lack of shelter, information shared with aid organisation Medical Aid for Palestinians.\nThe hospital called for immediate aid, including shelter caravans and fuel, to improve living conditions amid the harsh winter cold and safeguard young children.\n\"We appeal to the relevant authorities to provide caravans, camps, and fuel to provide warmth for people and protect children, especially with the arrival of a new low-pressure system,\" Dr Salah shared with the aid organisation.\nHealthcare workers have said the deaths are happening as Israel continues to block the entry of tents and mobile homes into Gaza. The hospital highlighted the living conditions Palestinians are facing as the enclave is hit with freezing temperatures as low as 10°C.\nIsraeli airstrikes have rendered over 280,000 families homeless, being forced to live in tents and partially destroyed homes that have no protection from the cold.\nThey say immediate action is crucial to saving the lives of newborns and vulnerable children in Gaza.\nThe Palestinian Meteorological Department said the territory will continue to be affected by the cold throughout the week, with slight rises in temperature.\nThe United Nations revealed at least eight newborns died in December alone of hypothermia in Gaza.\nDespite a ceasefire coming into effect on 19 January, Israel continues to delay vital aid to the Gaza Strip, affecting the thousands of Palestinians in the enclave.\nIsrael's war on Gaza has killed over 61,000 Palestinians since October 2023, with many estimated to be trapped under the rubble.\nIsrael has threatened to resume its war if ceasefire talks fail to progress this week.",

         "At least six babies have died from hypothermia in the last two weeks in the Gaza Strip according to Palestinian medics.\nHundreds of thousands of people are living in tent camps and war-damaged buildings during a fragile ceasefire, while temperatures have dropped considerably.\nThe coastal territory experiences cold and wet winters, with temperatures averaging below 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) at night and storms blowing in from the Mediterranean Sea. It has been especially cold over the last few days.\nHaunting new nuclear map shows where 75% of US population would die in WW3\nDoctor warns 'early' sign of dementia appears when watching TV - what to look out for\nTragically, Yusuf al-Shinbari woke up in his family's tent just after midnight on Tuesday to find that his 2-month-old daughter, Sham, was cold to the touch and had no heartbeat.\nHe said, \"Yesterday, I was playing with her. I was happy with her. She was a beautiful child, like the moon.\"\nGaza-based Dr. Ahmed al-Farah confirmed Sham did not die of any illness but from a severe cold because she was in a tent. He said the hospital had also treated another two infants for frostbite.\nSaeed Salah, of the Patient's Friends Hospital in Gaza City, said five infants aged one month or younger have died from the cold over the last two weeks, including a 1-month-old who died on Monday. Another child has been placed on a ventilator, Salah said.\nHead of the Health Ministry’s records department in Gaza, Zaher al-Wahedi, said it has recorded 15 deaths from hypothermia this winter, all of them children.\nWhile the ceasefire has allowed a surge in humanitarian aid, residents say there are still shortages of blankets and warm clothing, and little wood available for fires.\nThere's been no central electricity in Gaza since the first few days of the war, and fuel for generators is scarce. Many families are forced to huddle on damp sand or bare concrete.\nRosalia Bollen, a spokesperson for the United Nations Children's agency, said earlier this month, \"It's incredibly cold. I have no clue how people can sleep at night in their makeshift tents.\"\nIsrael's military offensive, launched in response to the attack by Hamas in October 2023, in Gaza is estimated to have killed over 46,000 people, including 18,000 children.\nHundreds of thousands of people who have been able to return to northern Gaza under the ceasefire have settled wherever they can amid the ruins, but the harsh weather is making life even more difficult for them.\nMeanwhile, the ceasefire's first phase will end on Saturday and may not be extended, and if fighting does resume, the current flow of humanitarian aid is expected to drop dramatically.\nEven if the ceasefire holds, it is unclear when anything in Gaza will be rebuilt. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction to be over $50 billion, and just clearing the rubble could take years to complete.",

Cinco de ellos murieron en Ciudad de Gaza y otro de ellos identificado como Yousef Al Shambari de poco más de un mes falleció dentro de su tienda de campaña en la zona humanitaria de Mawasi, en el sur de la Franja.\n\"Llegaron con una temperatura muy baja, como si fueran bloques de hielo y sufrieron una caída en la circulación sanguínea.

Además, Wafa informó de que al menos otros tres bebés están en estado crítico por el intenso frío.\nLa mayoría de la población gazatí, pese a la llegada del alto el fuego, sigue malviviendo en tiendas de campaña o en refugios improvisados rodeados de escombros, sin calefacción ni recursos suficientes para poder hacer frente a estas bajas temperaturas.\nLos colonos israelíes duplican sus agresiones en Cisjordania tras el alto el fuego en Gaza\nVer más\nEn este sentido, el director de la Oficina de Medios del Gobierno del enclave, Ismail Al Thawabtah, pidió a los mediadores y a la comunidad internacional en un comunicado adoptar \"medidas urgentes para proporcionar casas móviles como refugio temporal para las más de 280.000 familias palestinas que perdieron sus hogares\" así como el ingreso de \"combustible para dar calor y proteger a los niños inocentes\".\n\"La muerte de seis recién nacidos en la Franja de Gaza (...) es el resultado de las políticas criminales del gobierno de ocupación fascista y de su impedimento a la entrada de ayuda humanitaria y materiales de refugio para más de dos millones de ciudadanos, mientras la comunidad internacional continúa en silencio al abordar la catástrofe humanitaria\", denunció en otro comunicado Hamás.",

         "DEIR AL-BALAH, Franja de Gaza (AP) — Al menos seis bebés han muerto por hipotermia en las últimas dos semanas en la Franja de Gaza, donde cientos de miles de personas viven en campamentos de tiendas y edificios dañados por la guerra durante un frágil alto el fuego, dijeron médicos palestinos el martes.\nLas temperaturas han caído en los últimos días. El territorio costero experimenta inviernos fríos y húmedos, con temperaturas que descienden por debajo de los diez grados Celsius (50 grados Fahrenheit) por la noche y tormentas que soplan desde el mar Mediterráneo.\nEl doctor Ahmed al-Farah, jefe del departamento de pediatría en el Hospital Nasser en Jan Yunis, informó a The Associated Press que recibió el cuerpo de una niña de dos meses el martes. Dijo que otros dos bebés fueron tratados por congelación, y uno de ellos fue dado de alta más tarde.\nSaeed Saleh, del Hospital de Amigos del Paciente en la Ciudad de Gaza, indicó que cinco bebés de un mes o menos han muerto por el frío en las últimas dos semanas, incluyendo a un bebé de uno mes que falleció el lunes. Dijo que otro niño ha sido conectado a un respirador artificial.\nZaher al-Wahedi, jefe del departamento de registros del Ministerio de Sanidad de Gaza, declaró que este invierno se han registrado 15 muertes por hipotermia, todas ellas de niños.\nEl alto el fuego que detuvo 16 meses de guerra entre Israel y los milicianos de Hamás ha permitido un aumento en la ayuda humanitaria, principalmente alimentos, pero los residentes dicen que aún hay escasez de mantas y ropa de abrigo, y poca madera disponible para hacer fuego.\nNo ha habido electricidad central en Gaza desde los primeros días de la guerra, y el combustible para generadores es escaso. Muchas familias se agrupan sobre arena húmeda o concreto desnudo.\n“Hace un frío increíble”, dijo Rosalia Bollen, portavoz de la agencia de la ONU para la infancia, a principios de este mes. “No tengo idea de cómo pueden dormir las personas por la noche en sus tiendas improvisadas”.\nLa ofensiva militar de Israel, lanzada en respuesta al ataque de Hamás del siete de octubre de 2023, fue una de las más mortales y destructivas en la historia reciente. Redujo a escombros grandes áreas de Gaza. Las cientos de miles de personas que han podido regresar al norte de Gaza bajo el alto el fuego se han asentado donde pueden entre las ruinas.\nLa primera fase del alto el fuego terminará el sábado y puede que no se extienda. Si se reanuda la lucha, se espera que el actual flujo de ayuda humanitaria disminuya drásticamente.\nIncluso si la tregua se mantiene, no está claro cuándo se reconstruirá algo en Gaza. El Banco Mundial ha estimado el costo de la reconstrucción en más de 50.000 millones de dólares, y podría llevar años solo despejar los escombros.\nIsrael culpa de la destrucción a Hamás porque los milicianos posicionaron túneles, lanzadores de cohetes y otra infraestructura militar en áreas residenciales.\nHamás ha acusado a Israel de retrasar la entrada de casas móviles y tiendas en violación del alto el fuego. Israel niega las acusaciones y acusa a Hamás de violar el acuerdo. Israel retuvo la liberación de cientos de prisioneros palestinos el fin de semana pasado para protestar por la práctica de Hamás de exhibir a los rehenes ante multitudes en espectáculos públicos durante su liberación.\nLos combatientes liderados por Hamás mataron a unas 1.200 personas, en su mayoría civiles, en el ataque del siete de octubre y secuestraron a alrededor de 250 rehenes. Más de 60 aún están retenidos en Gaza, y se cree que alrededor de la mitad están muertos.\nLa guerra aérea y terrestre de Israel ha matado a más de 48.000 palestinos, en su mayoría mujeres y niños, según el Ministerio de Salud de Gaza. No se indica cuántos de los muertos eran milicianos. Israel afirma haber matado a más de 17.000 combatientes, pero no ha proporcionado evidencia.\n___\nMagdy informó desde El Cairo.\n___\nEsta historia fue traducida del inglés por un editor de AP con la ayuda de una herramienta de inteligencia artificial generativa.",
