         "Summary\nCompanies\nAlibaba, ByteDance, Tencent have boosted H20 purchases, sources say\nSmaller firms now buying servers with AI computing systems, source says\nTrump administration considering new H20 export controls, sources have said\nSINGAPORE/BEIJING, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Chinese companies are ramping up orders for Nvidia's (NVDA.O), opens new tab H20 artificial intelligence chip due to booming demand for DeepSeek's low-cost AI models, six people familiar with the matter said.\nThe surge in orders, which is being reported for the first time by Reuters, underlines Nvidia's dominance of the market and could help alleviate concerns that DeepSeek might cause a slide in AI chip demand.\nTencent (0700.HK), opens new tab, Alibaba (9988.HK), opens new tab and ByteDance have \"significantly increased\" orders of the H20 - a chip specific to China due to U.S. export controls - since the Chinese AI startup burst into the global public consciousness last month, two of the people said.\nIn addition to their internal needs for advanced AI chips, the three tech giants provide cloud computing services through which other firms can access and use AI tools.\nSmaller companies in sectors like healthcare and education are also purchasing AI servers equipped with DeepSeek models and Nvidia H20 chips, said a source at one of China's largest server makers. Previously only deep-pocketed financial and telecoms firms bought servers with AI computing systems, the source added.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's administration is looking at imposing restrictions on the sale of the H20 chip to China, Reuters has reported. While the threat of further controls could be a factor in the jump in orders, the sources cited DeepSeek as the reason.\nThe sources did not provide details on the size of the orders. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.\nNvidia did not respond to queries on how much demand for the H20 it was seeing from China but said its products won \"on merit in a competitive field\". The company is set to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday.\nTencent, ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to requests for comment.\nDeepSeek's large language models rival Western systems in performance at a fraction of the cost as they focus on \"inference\" or producing conclusions. That optimises computational efficiency rather than relying solely on raw processing power.\n\"When DeepSeek launched, many misjudged that computing power demand might stagnate or decrease. In reality, more advanced AI models drive deeper integration into daily life, exponentially increasing inference-level compute need,\" said Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners.\nA DeepSeek-induced global rout in AI stocks that began January 24 saw Nvidia shares lose as much as a fifth of their value at one point but they have since regained most of that ground and are down just 3% for the year to date.\nThough wider deployment of DeepSeek AI models is expected to help Chinese chipmakers such as Huawei(HWT.UL) better compete in the domestic market thanks to the models' focus on inference, Nvidia's H20 chip remains the industry standard in China.\nAnalysts estimate Nvidia shipped approximately 1 million H20 units in 2024, generating over $12 billion in revenue for the company.\nThe H20 is the primary chip Nvidia is legally permitted to sell in China and was launched after the latest round of U.S. export restrictions took effect in October 2023. Washington has banned exports of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China since 2022, concerned that advanced technologies could be used by China to build up its military capabilities.\nNumerous Chinese companies have announced plans to use DeepSeek's models. Among them are Tencent, which has said it will beta test integrating the models into its highly popular WeChat messaging app, and automaker Great Wall (601633.SS), opens new tab which has integrated DeepSeek's model into its connected vehicle system.\nThe Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day.

         "Chinese tech giants Tencent Holdings TCEHY, Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd BABA, and ByteDance have significantly increased orders for Nvidia Corporation's NVDA H20 AI chips, as the rise of DeepSeek's low-cost AI models drives a surge in demand for AI computing power.\nWhat Happened: The spike in H20 chip orders, reported by Reuters, citing six people familiar with the matter, highlights Nvidia's continued dominance in the AI chip market.\nThe H20 is a China-specific chip, developed in response to U.S. export restrictions that prevent Nvidia from selling its most advanced AI hardware to Chinese companies.\nWhile concerns about additional U.S. trade restrictions exist, sources say the primary driver behind the demand is DeepSeek's AI models, which optimize computational efficiency for inference tasks rather than relying solely on raw processing power.\nSee Also: Google Sued Over AI Search Overviews — Education Company Says Tech Giant Is Stealing Content And Driving Publishers Out Of Business\nThese models have gained rapid adoption across industries, from cloud computing to automotive applications.\nTencent is reportedly testing DeepSeek's AI models in WeChat, while automaker Great Wall has integrated them into its connected vehicle systems. Analysts estimate Nvidia shipped around 1 million H20 chips in 2024, generating over $12 billion in revenue.\nWhy It Matters: Last month, Nvidia recognized China's DeepSeek R1 AI model. The model built for less than $6 million, allegedly outperformed top U.S. models, including those from OpenAI.\nThis milestone contributed to a broader tech market downturn, leading to a 17% decline in Nvidia's stock and a more than 20% plunge in AI infrastructure shares. It also led to a $600 billion drop in Nvidia's market capitalization.\nEarlier this month, in an interview, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed investor concerns, attributing the sell-off to misconceptions about AI infrastructure spending.\nPrice Action: In after-hours trading, Nvidia rose 0.51%, reaching $130.95 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.\nImage via Shutterstock\nRead Next:\nElon Musk’s $97.4 Billion OpenAI Takeover Bid Reportedly Not Received By ChatGPT Parent: ‘Another One Of His Tactics,’ Says Sam Altman",

Previously only deep-pocketed financial and telecoms firms bought servers with AI computing systems, the source added.\nU.S. President Donald Trump's administration is looking at imposing restrictions on the sale of the H20 chip to China, Reuters has reported. While the threat of further controls could be a factor in the jump in orders, the sources cited DeepSeek as the reason.\nThe sources did not provide details on the size of the orders. They were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.\nNvidia did not respond to queries on how much demand for the H20 it was seeing from China but said its products won \"on merit in a competitive field\". The company is set to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday.\nTencent, ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to requests for comment.\nDeepSeek's large language models rival Western systems in performance at a fraction of the cost as they focus on \"inference\" or producing conclusions. That optimises computational efficiency rather than relying solely on raw processing power.\n\"When DeepSeek launched, many misjudged that computing power demand might stagnate or decrease. In reality, more advanced AI models drive deeper integration into daily life, exponentially increasing inference-level compute need,\" said Nori Chiou, investment director at Singapore-based White Oak Capital Partners (WA:).\nA DeepSeek-induced global rout in AI stocks that began January 24 saw Nvidia shares lose as much as a fifth of their value at one point but they have since regained most of that ground and are down just 3% for the year to date.\nThough wider deployment of DeepSeek AI models is expected to help Chinese chipmakers such as Huawei better compete in the domestic market thanks to the models' focus on inference, Nvidia's H20 chip remains the industry standard in China.\nAnalysts estimate Nvidia shipped approximately 1 million H20 units in 2024, generating over $12 billion in revenue for the company.\nThe H20 is the primary chip Nvidia is legally permitted to sell in China and was launched after the latest round of U.S. export restrictions took effect in October 2023. Washington has banned exports of Nvidia's most advanced chips to China since 2022, concerned that advanced technologies could be used by China to build up its military capabilities.\nNumerous Chinese companies have announced plans to use DeepSeek's models. Among them are Tencent, which has said it will beta test integrating the models into its highly popular WeChat messaging app, and automaker Great Wall which has integrated DeepSeek's model into its connected vehicle system.",

         "Summary\nCompanies\nDeepSeek likely to release next-generation R2 model before May - sources\nStartup shuns typical Chinese tech giant culture, is known for flat hierarchy\nChina embraces DeepSeek after initial regulatory concerns about its mass chip purchases\nFirm instructed to keep low-profile amid global concerns about its privacy practices\nBEIJING/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Feb 25 (Reuters) - DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.\nThe Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.\nNow, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January's R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.\nDeepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.\nThe company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2's release have not been previously reported.\nDeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nRivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants.\n\"The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,\" said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models \"would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,\" he said.\nR2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.\nLittle is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as \"low-key and introverted,\" has not spoken to any media since July 2024.\nReuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.\nThey told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China's high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.\nDIFFERENT PATH\nLiang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.\nOne of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a \"flat management style.\"\nAt DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and \"996\" - working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.\nLiang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China's two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere.\n\"Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,\" said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. \"DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.\"\nLiang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek.\nWhile Baidu and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model's quality.\nBoth DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang.\nThe largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China's most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry.\nCOMPUTING POWER\nDeepSeek's success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer's decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said.\nThe quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going \"all in\" on AI by re-investing 70% of its revenue, mostly into AI research.\nHigh-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models.\nDeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials' thinking.\n\"Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?\" the person said. \"How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?\"\nAuthorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek's fortunes: the U.S. banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation.\nBeijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking.\nAuthorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said.\nChina's cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China's securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China's best research talent, two former employees said.\n\"The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,\" said Liu, the former employee.\nSome Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters' requests to provide proof.\nDeepSeek has not responded to Wang's claims. Two former employees attributed the company's success to Liang's focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.\nThe startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.\nThe MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.\nMLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.\nWhile competitors like France's Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.\nDeepSeek's pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.\nFor now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek's success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.\nOpenAI cut prices this month, while Google's Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1's launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.\nAdnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI's scaled-down model.\nSTATE EMBRACE\nEven before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing's favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms.\nThe subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing's belief that it can out-innovate the U.S., with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms.\nAt least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies say they have deployed DeepSeek into their systems, while tech giants Lenovo (0992.HK), opens new tab, Baidu (9888.HK), opens new tab and Tencent (0700.HK), opens new tab - owner of China's largest social media app WeChat - have integrated DeepSeek's models into their products.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Li \"have signalled they endorse DeepSeek,\" said Alfred Wu, an expert on Chinese policymaking at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \"Now everyone just endorses it.\"\nThe Chinese embrace comes as governments from South Korea to Italy remove DeepSeek from national app stores, citing privacy concerns.\n\"If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,\" said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital.\nFurther limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged.\n\"Our problem has never been funding,\" he told Waves in July. \"It's the embargo on high-end chips.\"\nThe Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day.

         "By Eduardo Baptista, Julie Zhu and Fanny Potkin\nBEIJING/HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.\nThe Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.\nNow, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January's R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.\nDeepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.\nThe company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2's release have not been previously reported.\nDeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nRivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants.\n\"The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,\" said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models \"would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,\" he said.\nSPONSORED\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\n1.

Get started today!\nR2 is likely to worry the U.S. government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.\nLittle is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as \"low-key and introverted,\" has not spoken to any media since July 2024.\nReuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.\nThey told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China's high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.\nDIFFERENT PATH\nLiang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.\nOne of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb. 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a \"flat management style.\"\nAt DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and \"996\" - working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.\nLiang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China's two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere.\n\"Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,\" said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. \"DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.\"\nLiang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek.\nWhile Baidu and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model's quality.\nBoth DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang.\nThe largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China's most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry.\nCOMPUTING POWER\nDeepSeek's success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer's decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said.\nThe quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going \"all in\" on AI by re-investing 70% of its revenue, mostly into AI research.\nHigh-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models.\nDeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials' thinking.\n\"Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?\" the person said. \"How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?\"\nAuthorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek's fortunes: the U.S. banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation.\nBeijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking.\nAuthorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said.\nChina's cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China's securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China's best research talent, two former employees said.\n\"The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,\" said Liu, the former employee.\nSome Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters' requests to provide proof.\nDeepSeek has not responded to Wang's claims. Two former employees attributed the company's success to Liang's focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.\nThe startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.\nThe MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.\nMLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.\nWhile competitors like France's Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.\nDeepSeek's pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.\nFor now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek's success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.\nOpenAI cut prices this month, while Google's Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1's launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.\nAdnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI's scaled-down model.\nSTATE EMBRACE\nEven before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing's favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms.\nThe subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing's belief that it can out-innovate the U.S., with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms.\n\"If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,\" said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital.\nFurther limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged.\n\"Our problem has never been funding,\" he told Waves in July. \"It's the embargo on high-end chips.\"\n(Additional reporting by Samuel Shen, Gu Li, Larissa Liao, Aditya Soni and Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Brenda Goh and Katerina Ang)",

         "After taking the world by storm with the debut of its R1 reasoning model in January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek is reportedly looking to maintain the momentum by rushing its new R2 model to market as quickly as possible, Reuters reports.\nDeepSeek at first planned to launch R2 in early May, but sources familiar with the company tell Reuters that DeepSeek wants to speed up the schedule. However, the sources didn’t provide a new release date for DeepSeek-R2, which has yet to be announced.\nWe don’t know much about DeepSeek’s next AI model yet, but the Chinese company wants R2 to have improved coding skills and reason in languages other than English.\nWhen DeepSeek-R1 launched, the entire industry was taken aback by the research paper that claimed the highly sophisticated model was trained at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s o1. The pushback was immediate, though, as OpenAI posited that DeepSeek distilled ChatGPT to train its model, and Google called DeepSeek’s claims “exaggerated.”\nNevertheless, many companies were quick to adopt the new model, including OpenAI investor Microsoft, which added DeepSeek-R1 to Azure AI Foundry and GitHub. You can also find R1 in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) model catalog.",

         "DeepSeek is looking to press home its advantage.\nThe Chinese startup triggered a $1 trillion-plus sell-off in global equities markets last month with a cut-price AI reasoning model that outperformed many Western competitors.\nNow, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January's R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company.\nDeepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics.\nThe company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2's release have not been previously reported.\nDeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\nRivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by US tech giants.\n\"The launch of DeepSeek's R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,\" said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek's success at creating cost-effective AI models \"would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts ... breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,\" he said.\nR2 is likely to worry the US government, which has identified leadership of AI as a national priority. Its release may further galvanize Chinese authorities and companies, dozens of which say they have started integrating DeepSeek models into their products.\nLittle is known about DeepSeek, whose founder Liang Wenfeng became a billionaire through his quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer. Liang, who was described by a former employer as \"low-key and introverted,\" has not spoken to any media since July 2024.\nReuters interviewed a dozen former employees, as well as quant fund professionals knowledgeable about the operations of DeepSeek and its parent company High-Flyer. It also reviewed state media articles, social-media posts from the companies and research papers dating back to 2019.\nThey told a story of a company that functioned more like a research lab than a for-profit enterprise and was unencumbered by the hierarchical traditions of China's high-pressure tech industry, even as it became responsible for what many investors see as the latest breakthrough in AI.\nDIFFERENT PATH\nLiang was born in 1985 in a rural village in the southern province of Guangdong. He later obtained communication engineering degrees at the elite Zhejiang University.\nOne of his first jobs was running a research department at a smart imaging firm in Shanghai. His then-boss, Zhou Chaoen, told state media on Feb 9 that Liang had hired prize-winning algorithm engineers and operated with a \"flat management style.\"\nAt DeepSeek and High-Flyer, Liang has similarly shunned the practices of Chinese tech giants known for rigid top-down management, low pay for young employees and \"996\" - working from 9am to 9pm six days a week.\nLiang opened his Beijing office within walking distance of Tsinghua University and Peking University, China's two most prestigious education institutions. He regularly delved into technical details and was happy to work alongside Gen-Z interns and recent graduates that comprised the bulk of its workforce, according to two former employees. They also described usually working eight-hour days in a collaborative atmosphere.\n\"Liang gave us control and treated us as experts. He constantly asked questions and learned alongside us,\" said 26-year-old researcher Benjamin Liu, who left the company in September. \"DeepSeek allowed me to take ownership of critical parts of the pipeline, which was very exciting.\"\nLiang did not respond to questions sent via DeepSeek.\nWhile Baidu and other Chinese tech giants were racing to build their consumer-facing versions of ChatGPT in 2023 and profit off of the global AI boom, Liang told Chinese media outlet Waves last year that he deliberately avoided spending heavily on app development, focusing instead on refining the AI model's quality.\nBoth DeepSeek and High-Flyer are known for paying generously, according to three people familiar with its compensation practices. At High-Flyer, it is not uncommon for a senior data scientist to make 1.5 million yuan annually, while competitors rarely pay more than 800,000, said one of the people, a rival quant fund manager who knows Liang.\nThe largesse was funded by High-Flyer, which became one of China's most successful quant funds and, even after a government crackdown on the sector, still manages tens of billions of yuan, according to two people in the industry.\nCOMPUTING POWER\nDeepSeek's success with a low-cost AI model is based on High-Flyer's decade-long and substantial investment in research and computing power, three people said.\nThe quant fund was an earlier pioneer in AI trading and a top executive said in 2020 that High-Flyer was going \"all in\" on AI by re-investing 70 percent of its revenue, mostly into AI research.\nHigh-Flyer spent 1.2 billion yuan on two supercomputing AI clusters in 2020 and 2021. The second cluster, Fire-Flyer II, was made up of around 10,000 Nvidia A100 chips, used for training AI models.\nDeepSeek had not been established at that time, so the accumulation of computing power caught the attention of Chinese securities regulators, said a person with direct knowledge of officials' thinking.\n\"Regulators wanted to know why they need so many chips?\" the person said. \"How they were going to use it? What kind of impact would that have on the market?\"\nAuthorities decided not to intervene, in a move that would prove crucial for DeepSeek's fortunes: the US banned the export of A100 chips to China in 2022, at which point Fire-Flyer II was already in operation.\nBeijing now celebrates DeepSeek, but has instructed it not to engage with the media without approval, according to a person familiar with Chinese official thinking.\nAuthorities had asked Liang to keep a low-profile because they were worried that too much hype in the media would draw unnecessary attention, the person said.\nChina's cabinet and commerce ministry, as well as China's securities regulator, did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs one of the few companies with a large A100 cluster, High-Flyer and DeepSeek were able to attract some of China's best research talent, two former employees said.\n\"The key advantage of vast (computing) resources is that it allows for large-scale experimentation,\" said Liu, the former employee.\nSome Western AI entrepreneurs, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, have claimed that DeepSeek had as many as 50,000 higher-end Nvidia chips that are banned for export to China. He has not produced evidence for the allegation or responded to Reuters' requests to provide proof.\nDeepSeek has not responded to Wang's claims. Two former employees attributed the company's success to Liang's focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.\nThe startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.\nThe MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.\nMLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.\nWhile competitors like France's Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.\nDeepSeek's pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.\nFor now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek's success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.\nOpenAI cut prices this month, while Google's Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1's launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.\nAdnan Masood of US tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI's scaled-down model.\nSTATE EMBRACE\nEven before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing's favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms.\nThe subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing's belief that it can out-innovate the US, with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms.\nAt least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies say they have deployed DeepSeek into their systems, while tech giants Lenovo 0992.HK, Baidu 9888.HK and Tencent 0700.HK - owner of China's largest social media app WeChat - have integrated DeepSeek's models into their products.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Li \"have signalled they endorse DeepSeek,\" said Alfred Wu, an expert on Chinese policymaking at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \"Now everyone just endorses it.\"\nThe Chinese embrace comes as governments from South Korea to Italy remove DeepSeek from national app stores, citing privacy concerns.\n\"If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,\" said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital.\nFurther limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged.\n\"Our problem has never been funding,\" he told Waves in July. \"It's the embargo on high-end chips.\"",

         "Though funding remains limited, efforts are underway to launch India's own multilingual low-cost generative AI",
         "https://images.forbesindia.com/media/images/2025/Feb/img_243409_generativeai.jpg",
         "India's AI mission proposes subsidising chips for application and product development, but Vardhan has advocated for allocating funds to build foundational technology as well. LLMs, focussed on text-based tasks, can be seen as a subset of foundation models, which a broader set of general-purpose AI models that can perform a range of natural language processing-based tasks.\nInvestors have remained hesitant to fund foundational projects, citing high costs and uncertainty. With growing interest from the government and large companies, key stakeholders have now started showing interest, explains Vardhan, who is developing a generative AI model with 9 trillion data points, which he says will operate at a significantly lower cost.\n“By hosting our model on Indian servers, we've reduced costs to nearly one-third of DeepSeek's token costs. This will make our model extremely affordable, enabling widespread adoption and potentially disrupting the market,” he adds. He plans to release the model by April.\nA big challenge in India is its diversity of languages, with 22 scheduled languages and hundreds of dialects and so on; it is a problem that doesn’t exist in the English-speaking world or in China. Most existing AI models struggle with India-specific use cases due to a lack of training data.\n“Our next generation is mixing English with Hindi characters, so AI needs to be multilingual, understand dialects, and understand nuances,” says Pranav Mistry, founder of TWO AI, a multilingual and cost-efficient language model startup building from Silicon Valley for the Asian market.\nTWO AI recently introduced Sutra-R0, a reasoning model for structured thinking and complex decision-making in various languages and domains. The model addresses enterprise and consumer needs with its efficient resource usage and multilingual capabilities. Backed by a $20-million seed fund from Jio Platforms (a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, publishers of Forbes India) and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver, TWO AI’s ChatSutra has 1.5 million users in multiple languages, including Gujarati, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indonesian.\n“In our first revenue-generating quarter, we made $7 million [last quarter]. This quarter, we've already reached a $10 million run rate,” adds Mistry, who launched TWO AI three and a half years ago. The company is working with major banks in South Korea and India, finance institutions, mortgage groups, and retail applications.\nSutra’s makers say it was “trained from scratch” and developed over a period of 18 months. They fed it a mix of open and proprietary datasets, allowing it to learn structure, grammar, facts, and reasoning on its own. This has made it more cost-efficient to train and run, particularly in non-English languages, where it outperforms some existing models, they say.\nIndia also needs better localised datasets. Government-backed Bhashini, a language translation technology project, and IT services company Tech Mahindra’s Project Indus have also built models tailored to the country's linguistic diversity. Bhashini has created an open-source Indic language dataset to expand internet accessibility in Indian languages like Hindi, Tamil, and Bengali.\n“We've developed our models from square one, leveraging encoder-decoder technologies and other fundamental AI technologies. To achieve this, we collaborated with approximately 70 research institutes across India,” says Amitabh Nag, CEO of Bhashini, which enables real-time speech translation in 22 languages.\nCurrently, it’s processing about 3.6 million inferences daily, with 166 million inferences in January alone. “If OpenAI wants to support English and a few other languages, we step in as the translation engine. We translate customer input from their local language to English, which is then processed by OpenAI's prompt engineering. The response is then translated back to the customer's local language,” explains Nag.\nAlso Read: Five questions to Manav Garg on Together's AI bets in India\nTech Mahindra’s Project Indus, launched last year in collaboration with Dell Technologies and Intel, created an AI model that understands and communicates in multiple Indic languages and dialects, starting with Hindi and its 37 variations. The differentiator of this project is its efficiency, says Nikhil Malhotra, chief innovation officer & global head of AI and Emerging Technologies at Tech Mahindra. “It’s built with an investment of less than $400,000. It demonstrates how high-quality AI solutions can be developed without high costs, making it an attractive model for enterprise adoption.”\nShortly after the launch of DeepSeek, Government of India’s IndiaAI Mission invited proposals from startups, researchers, and entrepreneurs to build foundation models for the country. The models can be LLMs or small language models (SLMs) across multimodal text, voice, or video. IndiaAI will fund these through grants, compute credits, or equity investment.\nSo far, the government has received over 60 proposals, which include players like Sarvam AI, CoRover.ai, and Ola’s Krutrim. The plan is to develop the country's own AI model within the next nine to 10 months, as promised by Minister of Electronics & IT Ashwini Vaishnaw.\n“We've received 69 proposals—a testament to the ecosystem's capabilities and confidence,” says Abhishek Singh, additional secretary, MeitY, and CEO of IndiaAI Mission. “The government will provide funding, but ultimately, venture capital [VC] firms and other investors must also contribute. Together, they'll need to collaborate to build something state-of-the-art, comparable to the world's best.”\nRahul Agarwalla, managing partner at SenseAI, an early-stage VC investing in AI-first startups, echoes Nandan Nilekani, former chairman of India’s Unique ID Authority, who has emphasised the need for population-scale AI applications. “Practically, we should focus on building applications that deliver value to people,” he says. “When I speak with founders, I emphasise the importance of solving real problems. While we support efforts to build LLMs, it's not a prerequisite for success.”\nLast year, $100 billion was invested in AI ventures worldwide, adds Agarwalla; almost 50 percent of US VC fund went to AI companies. In contrast, India received just $1 billion, accounting for only 1 percent of global AI investments.\nIndian homegrown AI models will have to compete with established players such as OpenAI and Google and other deeply funded ventures such as Anthropic.\n“The question remains: Is there a market for Indian homegrown models?” says Neil Shah, co-founder and vice president of research at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. “While it's possible to use global foundational models and train them with Indian data for local applications, creating a homegrown foundational model is a significant challenge.”\nSarvam AI, in Bengaluru, is exploring building on top of open-source models. Its Sarvam 1 model was built entirely from scratch, explains co-founder Vivek Raghavan, “but other models may be a combination of our development and open-source components. The approach varies depending on the application and requirements.”\nThe venture is preparing to submit a proposal to the Ministry of Electronics and IT to develop India's first indigenous foundational AI model. With the ministry announcing that at least six teams will undertake this ambitious project, Sarvam AI is positioning itself as a key contender. Sarvam AI plans to launch its foundational models by year-end, offering advanced capabilities in reasoning, research, and query-answering without relying on external supplements.\nIn making AI a reality in India, Raghavan sees three main challenges beyond investments: Building large models requires skilled professionals, access to relevant data is crucial, and managing computational resources efficiently. “These three ingredients—talent, data, and compute—are essential for success. With the right combination of these elements, I believe we can make significant progress in AI adoption in India,” he says.",

Two former employees attributed the company’s success to Liang’s focus on more cost-effective AI architecture.\nThe startup used techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and multihead latent attention (MLA), which incur far lower computing costs, its research papers show.\nThe MoE technique divides an AI model into different areas of expertise and activates only those related to a query, as opposed to more common architectures that use the entire model.\nMLA architecture allows a model to process different aspects of one piece of information simultaneously, helping it detect key details more effectively.\nWhile competitors like France’s Mistral have developed models based on MoE, DeepSeek was the first firm to depend heavily on this architecture while achieving parity with more expensively built models.\nDeepSeek’s pricing was 20 to 40 times cheaper than what OpenAI charged for equivalent models, analysts at Bernstein brokerage estimated in early February.\nFor now, Western and Chinese tech giants have signaled plans to continue heavy AI spending, but DeepSeek’s success with R1 and its earlier V3 model has prompted some to alter strategies.\nOpenAI cut prices this month, while Google’s Gemini has introduced discounted tiers of access. Since R1’s launch, OpenAI has also released an O3-Mini model that relies on less computing power.\nAdnan Masood of U.S. tech services provider UST told Reuters that his laboratory had run benchmarks that found R1 often used three times as many tokens, or units of data processed by the AI model, for reasoning as OpenAI’s scaled-down model.\nSTATE EMBRACE\nEven before R1 gripped global attention, there were signs that DeepSeek had caught Beijing’s favor. In January, state media reported that Liang attended a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing as the designated representative of the AI sector, ahead of the leaders of better-known firms.\nThe subsequent fanfare over the cost competitiveness of its models has buoyed Beijing’s belief that it can out-innovate the U.S., with Chinese companies and government bodies embracing DeepSeek models at a pace that has not been offered to other firms.\nAt least 13 Chinese city governments and 10 state-owned energy companies say they have deployed DeepSeek into their systems, while tech giants Lenovo, Baidu and Tencent – owner of China’s largest social media app WeChat – have integrated DeepSeek’s models into their products.\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and Li “have signalled they endorse DeepSeek,” said Alfred Wu, an expert on Chinese policymaking at Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “Now everyone just endorses it.”\nThe Chinese embrace comes as governments from South Korea to Italy remove DeepSeek from national app stores, citing privacy concerns.\n“If DeepSeek becomes the go-to AI model across Chinese state entities, Western regulators might see this as another reason to escalate restrictions on AI chips or software collaborations,” said Stephen Wu, an AI expert and founder of hedge fund Carthage Capital.\nFurther limits on advanced AI chips are a challenge that Liang has acknowledged.\n“Our problem has never been funding,” he told Waves in July. “It’s the embargo on high-end chips.”\n(Additional reporting by Samuel Shen, Gu Li, Larissa Liao, Aditya Soni and Shanghai Newsroom; Editing by Brenda Goh and Katerina Ang)",

The court said there is no basis for requesting an urgent hearing. The court was hearing an application moved by the petitioner. On February 12, the Court asked the Union government’s counsel to seek instructions on the matter. It was listed again on February 20 but could not be taken up due to a lack of time, so the next date was April 16.\nEarlier, the court acknowledged the submissions made by the counsel, emphasizing that the matter requires careful consideration. The court further observed that artificial intelligence could be a dangerous tool in anyone’s hands, whether Chinese or American. The petition was filed in the Delhi High Court with the aim to block access to ‘DeepSeek,’ an artificial intelligence chatbot.\nThe petition claims that within a month of its launch, several vulnerabilities were discovered in DeepSeek, leading to the leak of over one million pieces of sensitive personal data online. This leaked information reportedly includes a significant amount of chat history. The plea further alleges that DeepSeek, developed by Chinese entities, is involved in unlawful operations.\nThe plea was moved by Bhavna Sharma, a practising Advocate, through plea claims that Several countries have raised concerns about DeepSeek’s privacy and security practices. As a result, Italy’s Data Protection Authority, ‘Garante,’ has banned DeepSeek for violating privacy laws.\nThe Australian government has also prohibited its use on all government devices due to security risks. Similarly, data regulators in Ireland, Belgium, Greece, South Korea, Taiwan, the USA, and France are investigating DeepSeek’s operations, the plea stated.\nAdditionally, India’s Ministry of Finance has issued an internal directive to government departments advising them against using AI tools like DeepSeek and ChatGPT on office devices due to potential risks to the confidentiality of government data and documents, the plea reads.",

Now, the Hangzhou-based firm is accelerating the launch of the successor to January’s R1 model, according to three people familiar with the company. Deepseek had planned to release R2 in early May but now wants it out as early as possible, two of them said, without providing specifics. The company says it hopes the new model will produce better coding and be able to reason in languages beyond English. Details of the accelerated timeline for R2’s release have not been previously reported. DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Rivals are still digesting the implications of R1, which was built with less-powerful Nvidia chips but is competitive with those developed at the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars by U.S. tech giants. “The launch of DeepSeek’s R2 model could be a pivotal moment in the AI industry,” said Vijayasimha Alilughatta, chief operating officer of Indian tech services provider Zensar. DeepSeek’s success at creating cost-effective AI models “would likely spur companies worldwide to accelerate their own efforts … breaking the stranglehold of the few dominant players in the field,” he said.\nFull report : DeepSeek likely to release next-generation R2 model before May even as U.S. vs China AI race enters new phase.",

         "The AI ecosystem has experienced a major shift, which may define the future of AI economy and investment. A Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, has introduced an AI model that is on par with the best in the market, such as ChatGPT by OpenAI, but it was created in a shorter time and at a lower cost. This is a significant shift in the financial and technological aspect and the effects are likely to be felt not only in the AI industry, investment markets, and even in the regulatory aspects. The development also raises important questions about whether large-scale investments in AI infrastructure are actually necessary or if more prudent designs like DeepSeek will become the norm. This shift may have a significant impact on, for instance, financial report analysis and algorithmic decision making processes and, therefore, on other sectors such as forex trading app development that rely on predictive analytics.\nOne of the most striking aspects of DeepSeek’s achievement is its budget. Some of the big AI players like Google, OpenAI, and Meta have spent billions of dollars developing their models whereas DeepSeek was able to create an AI system with the same level of performance for $5.6 million. This cost efficiency threatens the idea that cutting edge AI requires huge capital to develop, and thus allows new players and small companies to contend in the market. Hence, the investors who have invested their money in companies with high capacity to innovate in the area of AI may have to change their investment plans. The possibility of creating high-quality AI at lower costs means that AI investment will not be centralized in a few large corporations, which will lead to a more fragmented market with many competitors.\nNvidia, the company that builds the GPUs that are used largely in today’s AI development, has lost about $600 billion in market value according to reports due to concerns that cheaper forms of AI such as DeepSeek could reduce the need for its expensive processors. Although Nvidia and other similar firms will remain important actors in the AI infrastructure, investors are now wondering if the current AI spending model of Western tech companies is still reasonable.\nThe effects of DeepSeek’s growth are not only felt in the stock market but also in the geopolitical and regulatory level. AI is not only about the creation of new solutions it is also about the control. The success of DeepSeek has raised concerns that China is potentially gaining an important lead in AI with potential implications for national security to the West. When governments have usually left the development of AI to corporations, they may now have to act more forcefully either by offering subsidies to maintain competition or by imposing stricter rules to prevent the control of AI from shifting to other countries. However, it remains to be seen how the rising power of Chinese AI firms will affect international AI governance as policymakers seek to mitigate risks associated with state surveillance and propaganda.\nThis is not a completely unfounded fear as there is evidence that the AI model of DeepSeek is censoring content in real-time on politically sensitive subjects. DeepSeek has the censorship features integrated within the platform where it is impossible to discuss matters like Tiananmen Square or Taiwan. This high extent of preventative control reveals the cultural and philosophical distinctions between the AI created in democratic and authoritarian states. Investors and tech analysts will have to consider not only the technological features of the AI models but also the risks of applying AI systems that can be controlled by the government.\nHowever, the birth of a high-quality and low-cost AI model is undoubtedly good for the industries that depend on AI solutions. Companies in the healthcare, education, and financial sectors, among others, that have in the past struggled to incorporate complex AI integrations into their operations may now be able to gain access to powerful AI tools at lower costs. There is a possibility of democratizing AI, which can lead to new innovations in various industries and result in better patient care, smarter automation, and improved customer interactions. This means that companies that were once locked out of the market due to high entry fees will now be able to embrace AI and expand the technology’s coverage.\nThese developments are being met with changing investment strategies. VC firms who have previously focused on funding AI companies that require large compute capacity may start looking for companies that focus on computational efficiency and innovative architectures. This change may benefit AI startups outside of Silicon Valley and especially those in countries with limited resources. The reduced costs of developing AI may also lead more companies to focus on the applications of AI rather than the core AI research and may result in a new wave of AI-based startups focused on niche areas like legal services, supply chain management, and content creation.\nHowever, classic AI giants will probably have to modify their approaches. These companies, including Google and OpenAI, have gained their reputation from building big, resource-hungry AI models, and they may have to change their strategies and build lighter, more efficient models. This could result in a more balanced AI innovation environment in which both large corporations and small companies are equally important. It may also mean that AI producers will have to look for other ways to distinguish their models, such as through greater specialization, the use of proprietary data or unique deployment strategies.\nTherefore, the emergence of DeepSeek can be regarded as the beginning of a new AI generation. The notion that a few giant corporations can control the AI sector is being defeated, and this opens the door for new contenders and strategies. The investment community will have to act quickly and determine which companies are most likely to benefit from this shift. Although AI is one of the most important and growing sectors of technology, the rules of the game are changing. Therefore, those who grasp the importance of efficient AI development will be in the best position to benefit from this transformation.",

         "About a month ago, the world woke up to a shock. The release of the large language model DeepSeek R1, a chatbot with powerful reasoning capabilities, forced the tech world to reconsider its approach to artificial intelligence (AI) advancement altogether. DeepSeek — a subsidiary AI research company of a quantitative trading firm based in Hangzhou, China — caused losses in the stock market worth hundreds of billions for leading firms like OpenAI and Nvidia. Overnight, DeepSeek’s mobile app rose to the top spot in Apple’s App Store and stole the limelight in the AI field.\nDeepSeek’s meteoric surge is controversial, to say the least. Its R1 model can allegedly match the performance of leading models like OpenAI’s o1 at a fraction of the costs. The R1 is a smaller reasoning model trained from DeepSeek’s V3, a larger general-purpose model comparable to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The V3 reportedly cost less than $6 million to train (though the actual figure is heavily contested).\nU.S. embargoes on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) handicap AI firms based in China. GPUs were initially computer components designed for image processing on personal computers but have since then been used in cryptocurrency mining and AI development. Computing power is essential to model-training capabilities; more powerful and plentiful GPUs allow firms to train their models on more parameters, tuning them to produce more accurate and reliable answers. The fact that the R1 displayed comparable performances to leading models based in the United States, despite its purportedly low training costs and hardware limitations, was why the model sparked such strong reactions in the market and the media.\nThe AI arms race has become a crucial part of the United States’ foreign policy, especially with regard to China. The Stargate Project­ — a government-supported joint venture between OpenAI, Japan-based investment firm SoftBank and others that would invest more than $500 billion in AI infrastructure — makes clear the U.S. government’s great emphasis on AI competitiveness.\nAI has become an irreplaceable way for many of us to interact with information. From misleading news to videos, AI’s capability to spread misinformation and disinformation poses potential threats to truth and democracy. AI could be used as a means of cognitive warfare, challenging users’ beliefs and making them question their values.\nMany countries have already placed restrictions on DeepSeek’s models for this reason. Taiwan, whose sovereignty is the most immediately threatened by China, quickly banned using DeepSeek models on government devices. South Korea, Australia and some U.S. states have also restricted access to these models, citing similar concerns.\nAnything related to China and technology has become a target for politicization. TikTok was the last example, and now it’s DeepSeek. Most of these precautions are sufficiently backed by evidence and well-grounded in national security concerns. At the same time, the politicization of such technologies has cultivated a strong anti-China sentiment that stands in the way of academic research progress and international collaboration.\nIn response to DeepSeek’s models, OpenAI accused the company of breaching its intellectual property via a training method known as distillation. Distillation is when a large general model, known as the teacher model, is “distilled” into a smaller, usually more specialized model. It’s a common technique used in model training to slim down large models and allow them to be run with fewer hardware requirements. OpenAI has stated that there is evidence to prove that DeepSeek distilled its models, but it hasn’t publicly released anything concrete.\nHowever, the distillation controversy has been turned into an unproven, heavily politicized narrative. It feeds into other arguments, like suggesting that DeepSeek didn’t achieve anything remarkable or that it wouldn’t have existed without OpenAI. In reality, it has made breakthroughs in the mathematical and computational methods that optimize the AI training process, increasing its hardware and energy efficiency.\nInternational tension easily creates false narratives that belittle and antagonize. Regulatory measures against the use of technology in cognitive warfare are, of course, required to defend countries’ democracy and sovereignty. However, the excessive politicization of technology impedes our understanding and continuation of AI progress and innovation.\nIronically, OpenAI is not open at all, while DeepSeek is open-source. It’s also interesting to consider the numerous lawsuits OpenAI is facing for breaches of intellectual property, only for it to accuse another company of the same.\nThe point is that it is incredibly short-sighted and one-dimensional to use politicization to blindly diminish the achievements of other countries and blindly praise the ones of your own. Acknowledging and learning from what others have developed is the first step toward adapting and improving your own offerings.",

         "“About 4,000 employees may lose their jobs in the next three to four years owing to Artificial Intelligence (AI),” said Piyush Gupta, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of DBS Bank, at the NASSCOM Technology and Leadership Summit 2025. This would be a tenth of the company’s work force he said.\n“My current prediction, in the next three years, we’d shrink our workforce by 4,000, 10%. And that is because, AI is different” Mr. Gupta said at the event in Mumbai. He further said this was a much newer trend as he has never had to fire employees owing to technological transition so far.\n“The fact that technology will be good for customers and employees is a utopian view. This was because unlike other technologies, AI is self-creating,” he said. While he acknowledged the positive view that people will continue to find jobs, he said there would be “massive dislocations.”\n“When the car came and the stagecoach went, you would argue that at the end of the day, the economy is prospered, transportation and industry grew. But I can tell you, all the stagecoach drivers didn’t necessarily come so fast unless they learnt how to drive. So, if you go back to India, it’s been a large people (who) got displaced. And when people got displaced, the new jobs were not the same. So, you look at the jobs we are creating. We are getting a lot of jobs, the cyber security specialists, the AI people. But a lot of my traditional operations people, the clerical staff, all the time, it’s not easy for them for the transition,” Mr. Gupta said highlighting the effects of the AI on jobs.\nAI may not steal many jobs after all, it may just make workers more efficient\nMr. Gupta flagged that the number of jobs that are being created is smaller than the number being displaced. While on the one hand he appreciated the positive view of AI, he said the “dystopian view” was driven by the fact that he was struggling to create jobs for the first time in 15 years of being CEO.\nMeanwhile in a separate statement, the company said that the reduction of 4,000 employees over the next three years will primarily involve contract and temporary staff. The workforce reduction will also come from natural attrition, as temporary and contract roles roll off over the coming years.",

Permanent staff would not be affected, the outgoing chief executive said.\nA Bloomberg Intelligence report last month said global banks were expected to cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as AI encroached on tasks currently carried out by humans.\nMr Gupta reportedly said last year that his bank had been working on AI for over a decade. \"We today deploy over 800 AI models across 350 use cases and expect the measured economic impact of these to exceed S$1bn (£592m),\" he claimed.\nA report from the Institute for Public Policy Research warned that AI would likely have a “seismic impact” on the economy and society, particularly in sectors reliant on computer-based tasks.\nThe think tank’s analysis of 22,000 common tasks performed by human workers found that up to 70 per cent of computer-based roles could be significantly altered or even eliminated by AI.",

         "Mumbai:\nGlobal banking major DBS Group expects a 10 per cent reduction in its workforce over the next three years as artificial intelligence adoption goes deeper into the operations, its chief executive Piyush Gupta said on Monday.\nMr Gupta said AI is different and unlike any other technologies adopted in the past, and added that he is struggling to create new jobs for the first time in his over 15-year stint at the helm of the Singaporean bank.\n\"This year, my current projection is that in the next three years, we are going to shrink our workforce by 4,000 or 10 per cent,\" Mr Gupta said, speaking at the Indian IT industry lobby group Nasscom event here.\nAttributing his outlook to the advent of AI, Mr Gupta said, \"AI is very powerful. It can self-create and also mimick\".\nPointing out that AI is \"different\", Mr Gupta said in the last ten years, there have not been any job cuts in the group.\nHe reminisced that in 2016-17, the bank embarked on a digital transformation which was seen impacting 1,600 people but added that almost all of them were repurposed in consultation with unions and other representatives.\nHowever, the current challenge in the age of AI is also revolving around how to repurpose the workforce.\nIn a statement issued later, DBS Bank clarified that the reduction of 4,000 employees over the next three years will primarily involve contract and temporary staff.\nNatural attrition will also lead to a workforce reduction, the bank said, adding that as temporary and contract roles roll off over the coming years, the base will reduce.\nMr Gupta said the bank has been cautious about relying fully on AI when it comes to customer outreach because of aspects like hallucinations but added that it has done its first use case on reaching customer directly and plans to broadbase it by end of the year.\nDBS started implementing generative AI solutions two years back, and the entire benefits of generative AI are yet to be seen, Mr Gupta said.\nThe group is using AI across the business now, including customer outreach, credit underwriting and also hiring, Mr Gupta said, adding that its first brush with AI in 2012-13 was not very successful.",

Ms Tan Su Shan, currently DBS deputy CEO, will succeed Mr Gupta on March 28.\nGlobal banks will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as AI encroaches on tasks currently carried out by humans, said a Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) report in January. Chief information and technology officers surveyed for BI indicated that on average they expect a net 3 per cent of their workforce to be cut, according to the report.\nStill, many firms have stressed that the shift will result in roles being changed by technology, rather than replaced altogether.\nMs Teresa Heitsenrether, who oversees JPMorgan Chase’s AI efforts, said in November 2024 that the bank’s adoption of generative AI was so far augmenting jobs.

In a statement shared with FinancialExpress.com, the company said that the CEO was referring to temporary and contractual staff.\nIn a statement, DBS Bank said, “The reduction of 4,000 employees over the next three years will primarily involve contract and temporary staff. The workforce reduction will also come from natural attrition, as temporary and contract roles roll off over the coming years.”\nEarlier while speaking at a Nasscom event, Piyush Gupta had said that DBS Group anticipates a 10 per cent reduction in its workforce over the next three years due to deeper integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its operations. He highlighted how AI is unlike any other technology previously adopted, making workforce restructuring inevitable.\n“This year, my current projection is that in the next three years, we are going to shrink our workforce by 4,000 or 10 per cent,” Gupta had said, while adding “In my 15 years of being a CEO, for the first time, I’m struggling to create jobs. So far, I’ve always had a line of sight to what jobs I can create. This time I’m struggling to say how will I repurpose people to create jobs.”",

         "Singapore’s DBS Group sees its workforce shrinking by 4,000 or 10 per cent over the next three years, due to deployment of artificial intelligence, group CEO Piyush Gupta said at an industry event.\nIn a fireside chat at an event organised by Nasscom, Gupta said that in 2016-17 the bank had identified 1,600 jobs that were redundant due to increasing automation. The management worked with the unions and the staff to create a transition pathway and to find alternative roles for them within the organisation. While some of them retired and many others quit, around 1200 of them were absorbed in other roles. “So I’ve never had to fire anybody,” said Gupta.\nHowever, he projected a reduction in the workforce over the next three years because, “AI is different.” He pointed out that AI is not a tool that “you use”. “AI can actually self-create and can manipulate.” The bank has added 1,000 people in AI, he said.\nDBS bank has over 6,500 employees in India..\nin a clarification the bank said, “The reduction of 4,000 employees over the next three years will primarily involve contract and temporary staff. The workforce reduction will also come from natural attrition, as temporary and contract roles roll off over the coming years.”\nAlso read: Maharashtra sets sights on becoming India’s AI hub\nThe bank is using AI for internal job mobility, as well as to manage frauds, scams and risk. It is also using AI models for portfolio management as well as to onboard customers. “Our customer engagement rates are up… the volume of business that customers do is also up. Our ability to underwrite customers and bring them on board changes dramatically,” Gupta said, adding that it has 20 million clients now compared to 6 million a few years back.\nDBS Group, which last year marked three decades of its presence in India, reported income of S$22.3 billion in 2024 and net profit of S$11.4 billion.",

         "DBS Group Holdings plans to cut about 4,000 of its contract and temporary staff workforce over the next three years as artificial intelligence increasingly takes on roles carried out by human beings.\nSouth-east Asia’s largest lender has approximately 8,000 to 9,000 of such staff, according to chief executive officer Piyush Gupta replying to a query from Bloomberg News. He confirmed a Press Trust of India news agency report which said the bank will trim its workforce following further adoption of AI across its business.\nPermanent staff will not be affected, the outgoing CEO said. DBS has around 41,000 staff and Tan Su Shan, currently deputy CEO, will succeed Gupta on Mar 28.\nA DBS spokesperson said: “The reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as temp and contract roles roll off over the next few years.”\nMy current projection in the next three years, we’ll shrink our workforce by about 4,000 or 10%,” Gupta said at an industry conference in Mumbai. The outgoing CEO, however, said 1,000 new positions will be added in AI.\nGupta is among the first major banking chiefs to lay out details of possible job losses due to AI.\n“In my 15 years of being a CEO, for the first time, I’m struggling to create jobs. So far, I’ve always had a line of sight to what jobs I can create. This time I’m struggling to say how will I repurpose people to create jobs,” Gupta added.\nGlobal banks will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as artificial intelligence encroaches on tasks currently carried out by human workers, said a Bloomberg Intelligence report last month.\nChief information and technology officers surveyed for BI indicated that on average they expect a net 3 per cent of their workforce to be cut, according to the report.\nStill, many firms have stressed that the shift will result in roles being changed by technology, rather than replaced altogether. Teresa Heitsenrether, who oversees JPMorgan Chase’s AI efforts, said in November that the bank’s adoption of generative AI was so far augmenting jobs.\nIn its latest results announcement, DBS said net profit for the fourth quarter rose 11 per cent from a year ago. Net profit for the three months ended Dec 31, 2024, was S$2.52 billion, compared with S$2.27 billion previously, and was slightly short of expectations.\nExcluding one-off items – a S$100 million corporate social responsibility commitment to DBS Foundation and other charitable causes – Q4 net profit would have been up 10 per cent at S$2.62 billion.\nFollowing the results, analysts raised target prices and dividend estimates on DBS, predicting higher valuation ahead.\nMaybank said DBS was giving significant visibility on capital returns. While earnings could grow at just 1 per cent compound annual growth rate between FY2025 and FY2027, dividends could expand at 7 per cent, delivering yields higher than 6.5 per cent, it said.\nIt upgraded its estimate for dividend per share (DPS) by 14 to 22 per cent between FY2025 and FY2027.\nRHB added that one key highlight was DBS’ management providing clarity on the quantum of excess capital of S$8 billion, and reaffirming its commitment to return this to shareholders over the next three years.\nThat will start with a capital return dividend of S$0.15 per share per quarter for FY2025 that DBS announced on Monday.\nThat is over and above its earlier share buyback programme and a S$0.24 increase in ordinary DPS this year, RHB noted. After factoring in the capital return dividend, RHB’s estimate for its FY2025 DPS is S$3.06, from S$2.46. BLOOMBERG, REUTERS",

         "[Editor’s note: The article has been updated to reflect DBS’s statement.]\nDBS Group Holding’s outgoing CEO, Piyush Gupta, announced that the company plans to lay off 4,000 contract and temporary staff roles over the next three years as artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly takes on roles carried out by human beings.\nGupta made this announcement at an industry conference in Mumbai, India, yesterday (February 24), where he added that permanent staff will not be affected. However, he also shared that 1,000 new positions will be added in AI, CNA reports.\nIn my 15 years of being a CEO, for the first time, I’m struggling to create jobs. So far, I’ve always had a line of sight to what jobs I can create. This time, I’m struggling to say how I will repurpose people to create jobs.\nPiyush Gupta, outgoing CEO of DBS Group Holdings at a industry conference in Mumbai, India\nCurrently, the company has 8,000 to 9,000 employees in such positions and has a total headcount of around 41,000 staff.\nResponding to media enquiries from Vulcan Post, a spokesperson from DBS shared that the reduction in headcount will come from “natural attrition” as temporary and contract roles are completed in the next few years.\nOver the next 3 years, we envisage that AI could reduce the need to renew about 4,000 temporary/ contract staff across our 19 markets working on specific projects. As such, we expect the reduction in workforce will come from natural attrition as these temporary and contract roles are completed over the next few years.\nOur permanent staff across all our markets are not impacted.\nA DBS spokesperson responding to media enquiries from Vulcan Post\nAI replacing human roles at banks\nAccording to a Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) article in January, global banks will cut as many as 200,000 jobs in the next three to five years as AI encroaches on tasks currently carried out by human workers.\nChief information and technology officers surveyed for BI indicated that, on average, they expect a net 3% of their workforce to be cut. The report also shared that back and middle office roles and operations are most likely to be affected.\n“Any jobs involving routine, repetitive tasks are at risk. But AI will not eliminate them fully, rather it will lead to workforce transformation,” stated Tomasz Noetzel, a senior analyst from Bloomberg Intelligence, who also penned the report.\nHowever, this might lean more towards a “utopian view” for some, like Gupta. While he appreciated the perspective that people will continue to find jobs, he warned that there might be “massive dislocations,” The Hindu reports.\n“We are getting a lot of jobs, the cyber security specialists, the AI people. But a lot of my traditional operations people, the clerical staff, all the time, it’s not easy for them to transition [to new jobs created],” said the banking veteran, highlighting the effects of AI on jobs.\nBut not all hope is lost\nWith that said, there are ways for those in similar positions to “change” your predicament. We previously reported the five skills that Singaporeans can build to do what machines can’t. Here’s a list:\nData analysis and critical thinking skills\nBuilding functional and job-specific expertise\nProject Management\nCreativity\nAdvanced digital skills (eg. programming, AI literacy, etc)\nHowever, we also found that 19% of Singaporeans dedicate no time to reskill, which is above the regional average of 13%. This is where employers can play a pivotal role in helping employees build up their arsenal beyond degrees and paper qualifications.\nWhen asked how they intend to reassure their permanent staff in terms of job security, a DBS spokesperson expressed the company’s commitment to continue investing in upskilling and reskilling its employees to be “future-ready.”\n“We have identified around 13,000 staff for upskilling or reskilling and to date, over 10,000 have commenced their respective learning roadmaps, including on skills such as AI and data.”\nRead more articles on Artificial Intelligence here.\nRead more articles we have written on Singaporean businesses here.\nFeatured Image Credit: DBS Bank",
